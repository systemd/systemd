# Remove old temporary snapshots, but only at boot. Ideally we'd have
# "self-destroying" btrfs snapshots that go away if the last last
# reference to it does. To mimic a scheme like this at least remove
# the old snapshots on fresh boots, where we know they cannot be
# referenced anymore. Note that we actually remove all temporary files
# in /var/lib/machines/ at boot, which should be safe since the
# directory has defined semantics. In the root directory (where
# systemd-nspawn --ephemeral places snapshots) we are more strict, to
# avoid removing unrelated temporary files.
