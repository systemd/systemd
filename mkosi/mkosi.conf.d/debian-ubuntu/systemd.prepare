# The ?reverse-depends() pattern for some weird reason lists all the packages providing systemd-sysusers
# instead of just excluding it, so we add another pattern to filter out anything that conflicts with
# any other systemd packages so we filter out both opensysusers and systemd-sysusers-standalone. We also
# exclude packages that belong to the systemd source package as we'll install these later. Finally, we
# exclude virtual packages as trying to install these makes apt fail with an error saying we need to install
# a specific implementation even if one is already installed.
