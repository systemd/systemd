These things need to be done, or would be nice to have:

  o Log the relationship of the kernel name and the persistent disk name
    to syslog, so any error logged from the kernel can be associated with
    any of the links at that time.

These things are deprecated and scheduled for removal in a future
udev version:

  o remove broken %e enumeration
    (simple enumerations can't work and should go)

  o remove udevstart
    (we rely on the kernel "uevent" triggers of kernel 2.6.15 and no longer
     want to guess event properties from sysfs like udevstart is doing it)
