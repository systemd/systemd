This is a short list of things that needs to be done.  They are in no specific
order.  I will gladly accept patches for any of these items, or any other stuff
people offer up.

- more documentation (can never have too much.)
- document the config file format (it will change over time...)
- add proper man page
- add klibc to the build process (or make it easier to do) to get
  smaller binary
- import latest libsysfs and convert udev to use it.
- On remove, look up the device in the database (now that we have one) and
  delete what was created, not what the kernel is calling the device.
- add symlink generation and removal support
- better partition support (it's a hack right now, maybe new libsysfs changes
  can help out a lot here.)
- allow database to be queried by other programs
- split program into two pieces (daemon and helper that sends events to it).
  This will allow us to keep track of sequences, and lots of other needed
  stuff.
- keep track of current permissions on devices when daemon shuts down.
- better permission handling
- create kernel name to devfs name config file so that all of the devfs users
  will have an upgrade path.
- do early boot logic (putting udev into initramfs, handle pivot-root,
  etc.)
- add hooks to call D-BUS when new node is created or removed
- lots of other stuff...
- actually use the BUS= value to determine where the LABEL rule should look
  (right now it's ignored, and we only look in the current sysfs directory.)
  This is needed, for example, to look at the usb device's serial number of a
  usb-storage device, instead of the scsi device's sysfs directory for the
  serial number.
