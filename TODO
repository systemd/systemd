* udev-kernel.socket + udev.control.socket seems not
  to work, udevd is started but no fd is passed

F15:

* swap units that are activated by one name but shown in the kernel under another are semi-broken

F15 External:

* NFS, networkmanager ordering issue (PENDING)

* NM should pull in network.target (PENDING)
  https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=692008

* bluetooth should be possible to disable (PENDING)

* make anaconda write timeout=0 for encrypted devices

* fix broken Sockets=syslog-ng.socket packaging

Features:

* fix CUPS .path unit for globbing

* move PAM code into its own binary

* logind: ensure ACLs are updated on login and logout

* warn if the user stops a service but not its associated socket

* ensure we always set the facility when logging to kmsg

* service: pid file reading after reload doesn't work, since we don't reset the pid variable

* logind: spawn user@..service on login

* logind: non-local X11 server handling

* logind: use sysfs path in device hash table instead of sysname, as soon as fb driver is fixed

* possibly apply systemd-sysctl per network device subtrees on hotplug

* implement Register= switch in .socket units to enable registration
  in Avahi, RPC and other socket registration services.

* make sure people don't leave processes around after ExecStartPre=

* make sure systemd-ask-password-wall does not shutdown systemd-ask-password-console too early

* support presets

* kernel: add /proc/sys file exposing CAP_LAST_CAP?

* kernel: add device_type = "fb", "fbcon" to class "graphics"

* understand https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=672194

* readahead: use BTRFS_IOC_DEFRAG_RANGE instead of BTRFS_IOC_DEFRAG ioctl, with START_IO

* readahead: check whether a btrfs volume includes ssd by checking mount flag "ssd"

* support sd_notify() style notification when reload is finished (RELOADED=1)

* support sf_notify() style notification when shutting down, to make auto-exit bus services work

* verify that the AF_UNIX sockets of a service in the fs still exist
  when we start a service in order to avoid confusion when a user
  assumes starting a service is enough to make it accessible

* Make it possible to set the keymap independently from the font on
  the kernel cmdline. Right now setting one resets also the other.

* move nss-myhostname into systemd

* figure out a standard place to configure timezone name, inform myllynen@redhat.com

* add dbus call to convert snapshot into target, and a dbus call to generate target from current state

* detect LXC with $container=lxc

* drop /.readahead on bigger upgrades with yum

* add inode stat() check to readahead to suppress preloading changed files

* allow list of paths in config_parse_condition_path()

* show enablement status in systemctl status

* teach systemctl to enable unit files in arbitrary directories

* In systemctl make sure both is-enabled and is-active print a string, or neither.

* Implement:
    systemctl mask <unit>
    systemctl unmask <unit>
  Also support --temp to make this temporary by placing mask links in /run.

* perhaps add "systemctl reenable" as combination of "systemctl disable" and "systemctl enable"

* add support for /bin/mount -s

* GC unreferenced jobs (such as .device jobs)

* add JoinControllers= to system.conf to mount certain cgroup
  controllers together in order to guarantee atomic creation/addition
  of cgroups

* avoid DefaultStandardOutput=syslog to have any effect on StandardInput=socket services

* cgroup_notify_empty(): recursively check groups up the tree, too

* fix alsa mixer restore to not print error when no config is stored

* when failing to start a service due to ratelimiting, try again later, if restart=always is set

* write blog stories about:
  - enabling dbus services
  - status update
  - how to make changes to sysctl and sysfs attributes
  - remote access

* allow port=0 in .socket units

* rename systemd-logger to systemd-stdio-syslog-bridge

* take BSD file lock on tty devices when using them?

* avoid any flag files, or readahead files in /, we need to support r/o /
  or / on tmpfs like Android setups.

* move readahead files into /var, look for them with .path units

* teach dbus to activate all services it finds in /etc/systemd/services/org-*.service

* get process transport into dbus for systemctl -P/-H

* document default dependencies

* support systemd.whitelist=/systemd.blacklist= on the kernel command
  line.

* Find a way to replace /var/run, /var/lock directories with
  symlinks during an RPM package upgrade (filesystem.rpm or systemd.rpm).
  (lua code to create symlinks right away for new installations is in filesytem.rpm now)
  We soon want to get rid of var-run.mount var-lock.mount units:
    if mountpoint /run ; then
          umount /var/run || :
    else
          mount --move /var/run /run || mount --bind /var/run /run
    fi
    mv /var/run /var/.run.save
    ln -s /run /var/run
    echo "R /var/.run.save" > /etc/tmpfiles.d/remove-run-save.conf

* when key file cannot be found, read it from kbd in cryptsetup

* add switch to systemctl to show enabled but not running services. Or
  another switch that shows service that have been running since
  booting but aren't running anymore.

* reuse mkdtemp namespace dirs in /tmp?

* recreate systemd's D-Bus private socket file on SIGUSR2

* be more specific what failed:
    ...
    Unmounting file systems.
    Not all file systems unmounted, 1 left.
    Disabling swaps.
    Detaching loop devices.
    Detaching DM devices.
    Cannot finalize remaining file systems and devices, trying to kill remaining processes.
    Unmounting file systems.
    Not all file systems unmounted, 1 left.
    Cannot finalize remaining file systems and devices, giving up.
    ...

* check for compiled-in, but not active selinux, and don't print any warnings
  about policy loading. Probably check for available selinux in /proc/filesystems,
  and check for active selinux with getcon_raw() == "kernel"

* Support --test based on current system state

* show failure error string in "systemctl status"

* make sure timeouts are applied to Type=oneshot services.

* investigate whether the gnome pty helper should be moved into systemd, to provide cgroup support.

* need a way to apply mount options of api vfs from systemd unit files
  (or some other modern source?) instead of fstab?

* maybe introduce ExecRestartPre=

* figure out what happened to bluez patch

* Patch systemd-fsck to use -C and pass console fd to it

* configurable jitter for timer events

* Support ProcessNeededForShutdown=true to allow stuff like mdmon to
  be killed very late after the rootfs is read only? If implement pass
  this to shutdown binary via command line argument.

* dot output for --test showing the 'initial transaction'

* calendar time support in timer, iCalendar semantics for the timer stuff (RFC2445)
    http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git;a=commit;h=99ee5315dac6211e972fa3f23bcc9a0343ff58c4

* systemd --user
  - get PR_SET_ANCHOR merged: http://lkml.org/lkml/2010/2/2/165

* implicitly import "defaults" settings file into all types

* port over to LISTEN_FDS/LISTEN_PID:
   - uuidd    HAVEPATCH
   - rpcbind (/var/run/rpcbind.sock!) HAVEPATCH
   - cups     HAVEPATCH
   - postfix, saslauthd
   - apache/samba
   - libvirtd (/var/run/libvirt/libvirt-sock-ro)
   - bluetoothd (/var/run/sdp! @/org/bluez/audio!)
   - distccd

* fingerprint.target, wireless.target, gps.target, netdevice.target

* set_put(), hashmap_put() return values check. i.e. == 0 doesn't free()!

* io priority during initialization

* if a service fails too often, make the service enter failed mode, and the socket, too.

* systemctl list-jobs - show dependencies

* auditd service files

* add systemctl switch to dump transaction without executing it

* suspend, resume support?

* readahead: btrfs/LVM SSD detection

* add separate man page for [Install] settings

* allow runtime changing of log level and target

* drop cap bounding set in readahead and other services

External:

* udisks should not use udisks-part-id, instead use blkid. also not probe /dev/loopxxx

* snd-seq should go, https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=676095

* gnome-shell python script/glxinfo/is-accelerated must die

* make cryptsetup lower --iter-time

* patch kernel for xattr support in /dev, /proc/, /sys and /sys/fs/cgroup?

* patch kernel for cpu feature modalias for autoloading aes/kvm/...
    http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/ak/linux-misc-2.6.git;a=shortlog;h=refs/heads/cpuid-match
  (Rafael J. Wysocki's sysdev rework is on the way. After that CPUs can be exported a proper bus.)

* procps, psmisc, sysvinit-tools, hostname → util-linux-ng

Regularly:

* look for close() vs. close_nointr() vs. close_nointr_nofail()

* check for strerror(r) instead of strerror(-r)

* Use PR_SET_PROCTITLE_AREA if it becomes available in the kernel

* %m in printf() instead of strerror();

* pahole

* CFLAGS="-Wl,--gc-sections -Wl,--print-gc-sections -ffunction-sections -fdata-sections"
