Bugfixes:
* enabling an instance unit creates a pointless link, and
  the unit will be started with getty@getty.service:
    $ systemctl enable getty@.service
    ln -s '/usr/lib/systemd/system/getty@.service' '/etc/systemd/system/getty.target.wants/getty@.service'

* Dangling symlinks of .automount unit files in .wants/ directories, set up
  automount points even when the original .automount file did not exist
  anymore. Only the .mount unit was still around.

* properly handle .mount unit state tracking when two mount points are stacked one on top of another on the exact same mount point.

* shorten the message to sane length:

  Cannot add dependency job for unit display-manager.service, ignoring: Unit display-manager.service failed to load: No such file or directory. See system logs and 'systemctl status display-manager.service' for details.

* systemctl --root=container/ set-default ... is totally borked.

* sd_bus_unref() is broken regarding self-references and "pseudo thread-safety".
  See the comment in sd_bus_unref() for more..

External:

* Fedora: when installing fedora with yum --installroot /var/run is a directory, not a symlink
   https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=975864

* Fedora: add an rpmlint check that verifies that all unit files in the RPM are listed in %systemd_post macros.

* Fedora: post FPC ticket to move add %tmpfiles_create to the packaging guidelines

Features:

* add "M" as recursive version of "m" to tmpfiles, then use it for
  chowning /run/log/journal (but not /var/log/journal), so that we
  adjust the perms of journal files created before tmpfiles ran.

* expose "Locked" property on logind sesison objects

* add bus api to query unit file's X fields.

* consider adding RuntimeDirectoryUser= + RuntimeDirectoryGroup=

* sd-event: define more intervals where we will shift wakeup intervals around in, 1h, 6h, 24h, ...

* gpt-auto-generator:
  - Support LUKS for root devices
  - Define new partition type for encrypted swap? Support probed LUKS for encrypted swap?
  - Make /home automount rather than mount?

* improve journalctl performance by loading journal files
  lazily. Encode just enough information in the file name, so that we
  don't have to open it to know that it is not interesting for us, for
  the most common operations.

* support transient mount units

* add an "input" group to udev logic and add all input devices to it

* machined: provide calls GetMachineByAddress() on the manager
  interface to get the machine for a local IP address, and
  GetAddress() on the Machine interface to get the Address for a
  machine. Implement via forking off child process which quickly joins
  the cotnainer and passes data to parent. Show this in "machinectl
  status", and use it to implement NSS module to provide automatic
  name resolution for containers.

* add generator that pulls in systemd-network from containers when
  CAP_NET_ADMIN is set, more than the loopback device is defined, even
  when it is otherwise off

* MessageQueueMessageSize= and RLimitFSIZE= (and suchlike) should use parse_iec_size().

* "busctl status" works only as root on dbus1, since we cannot read
  /proc/$PID/exe

* systemctl: support --recursive for list-sockets, list-timers,
  ... too, not just for list-units.

* implement Distribute= in socket units to allow running multiple
  service instances processing the listening socket, and open this up
  for ReusePort=

* socket units: support creating sockets in different namespace,
  opening it up for JoinsNamespaceOf=. This would require to fork off
  a tiny process that joins the namespace and creates/binds the socket
  and passes this back to PID1 via SCM_RIGHTS. This also could be used
  to allow Chown/chgrp on sockets without requiring NSS in PID 1.

* New service property: maximum CPU and wallclock runtime for a service

* introduce bus call FreezeUnit(s, b), as well as "systemctl freeze
  $UNIT" and "systemctl thaw $UNIT" as wrappers around this. The calls
  should SIGSTOP all unit processes in a loop until all processes of
  it are fully stopped. This can later be used for app management by
  desktop UIs such as gnome-shell to freeze apps that are not visible
  on screen, not unlike how job control works on the shell

* completions:
 - manager property enumeration was broken when systemd moved to /usr/lib/

* cgroups:
  - implement per-slice CPUFairScheduling=1 switch
  - handle jointly mounted controllers correctly
  - introduce high-level settings for RT budget, swappiness
  - how to reset dynamically changed unit cgroup attributes sanely?
  - when reloading configuration, apply new cgroup configuration
  - when recursively showing the cgroup hierarchy, optionally also show
    the hierarchies of child processes

* transient units:
  - allow creating auxiliary units with the same call
  - add field to transient units that indicate whether systemd or somebody else saves/restores its settings, for integration with libvirt
  - ensure scope units may be started only a single time

* Automatically configure swap partition to use for hibernation by looking for largest swap partition on the root disk?

* when we detect low battery and no AC on boot, show pretty splash and refuse boot

* machined, localed: when we try to kill an empty cgroup, generate an ESRCH error over the bus

* libsystemd-journal, libsystemd-login, libudev: add calls to easily attach these objects to sd-event event loops

* be more careful what we export on the bus as (usec_t) 0 and (usec_t) -1

* unify dispatch table in systemctl_main() and friends

* Automatically configure swap partition to use for hibernation by looking for largest swap partition on the root disk?

* socket-proxyd: Use sd-resolve to resolve the server address

* rfkill,backlight: we probably should run the load tools inside of the udev rules so that the state is properly initialized by the time other software sees it

* After coming back from hibernation reset hibernation swap partition using the /dev/snapshot ioctl APIs

* If we try to find a unit via a dangling symlink, generate a clean
  error. Currently, we just ignore it and read the unit from the search
  path anyway.

* refuse boot if /etc/os-release is missing or /etc/machine-id cannot be set up

* given that logind now lets PID 1 do all nasty work, we can
  probably reduce the capability set it retains substantially.
  (we need CAP_SYS_ADMIN for drmSetMaster(), so maybe not worth it)

* btrfs raid assembly: some .device jobs stay stuck in the queue

* make sure gdm doesn't use multi-user-x but the new default X configuration file, and then remove multi-user-x from systemd

* man: the documentation of Restart= currently is very misleading and suggests the tools from ExecStartPre= might get restarted.

* load .d/*.conf dropins for device units

* gparted needs to disable auto-activation of mount units somehow, or
  maybe we should stop doing auto-activation of this after boot
  entirely. https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=701676
  Maybe take a BSD lock at the disk device node and teach udev to
  check for that and suppress event handling.

* allow implementation of InaccessibleDirectories=/ plus
  ReadOnlyDirectories=... for whitelisting files for a service.

* sd-bus:
  - when kdbus doesn't take our message without memfds, try again with memfds
  - systemd-bus-proxyd needs to enforce good old XML policy
  - port exit-on-idle logic to byebye ioctl
  - allow updating attach flags during runtime
  - pid1: peek into activating message when activating a service
  - introduce sd_bus_emit_object_added()/sd_bus_emit_object_removed() that automatically includes the build-in interfaces in the list
  - constructors for bus messages should probably not be OK with a NULL bus pointer
  - .busname units should not use get_user_creds()/get_cgroup_creds() but instead do NSS only in temporarily forked off child
  - see if we can drop more message validation on the sending side
  - add API to clone sd_bus_message objects
  - kdbus: matches against source or destination pids for an "strace -p"-like feel. Problem: The PID info needs to be available in userspace too...
  - longer term: priority inheritance
  - dbus spec updates:
       - kdbus mapping
       - NameLost/NameAcquired obsolete
       - GVariant
       - "const" properties (posted)
       - path escaping
  - update systemd.special(7) to mention that dbus.socket is only about the compatibility socket now
  - test bloom filter generation indexes
  - port to sd-resolve for connecting to TCP dbus servers

* sd-event
  - allow multiple signal handlers per signal?

* in the final killing spree, detect processes from the root directory, and
  complain loudly if they have argv[0][0] == '@' set.
  https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=961044

* investigate endianness issues of UUID vs. GUID

* dbus: when a unit failed to load (i.e. is in UNIT_ERROR state), we
  should be able to safely try another attempt when the bus call LoadUnit() is invoked.

* add a pam module that passes the hdd passphrase into the PAM stack and then expires it, for usage by gdm auto-login.

* add a pam module that on password changes updates any LUKS slot where the password matches

* maybe add a generator that looks for "systemd.run=" on the kernel cmdline for container usercases...

* timedatctl, localectl: possibly make some commands work without the daemon, for chroot situations...

* timedatectl: print a nicer message when enabling ntp fails because ntpd/chrony are not installed

* cgtop: make cgtop useful in a container

* test/:
  - add 'set -e' to scripts in test/
  - make stuff in test/ work with separate output dir

* systemctl delete x.snapshot leaves no trace in logs (at least at default level).

* make the coredump collector tool move itself into the user's cgroup
  so that the coredump is properly written to the user's own journal
  file.

* seems that when we follow symlinks to units we prefer the symlink
  destination path over /etc and /usr. We shouldn't do that. Instead
  /etc should always override /run+/usr and also any symlink
  destination.

* when isolating, try to figure out a way how we implicitly can order
  all units we stop before the isolating unit...

* teach ConditionKernelCommandLine= globs or regexes (in order to match foobar={no,0,off})

* after all byte-wise realloc() is slow, even on glibc, so i guess we
  need manual exponential loops after all

* BootLoaderSpec: Clarify that the kernel has to be in $BOOT. Clarify
  that the boot loader should be installed to the ESP. Define a way
  how an installer can figure out whether a BLS compliant boot loader
  is installed.

* think about requeuing jobs when daemon-reload is issued? usecase:
  the initrd issues a reload after fstab from the host is accessible
  and we might want to requeue the mounts local-fs acquired through
  that automatically.

* systemd-inhibit: make taking delay locks useful: support sending SIGINT or SIGTERM on PrepareForSleep()

* journal-or-kmsg is currently broken? See reverted commit 4a01181e460686d8b4a543b1dfa7f77c9e3c5ab8.

* remove any syslog support from log.c -- we probably can't do this before split-off udev is gone for good

* shutdown logging: store to EFI var, and store to USB stick?

* write UI tool that pops up emergency messages from the journal as notification

* think about window-manager-run-as-user-service problem: exit 0 → activate shutdown.target; exit != 0 → restart service

* use "log level" rather than "log priority" everywhere

* timedate: have global on/off switches for auto-time (NTP), and auto-timezone that connman can subscribe to.

* merge unit_kill_common() and unit_kill_context()

* introduce ExecCondition= in services

* EFI:
  - write man page for efi boot generator
  - honor language efi variables for default language selection (if there are any?)
  - honor timezone efi variables for default timezone selection (if there are any?)
  - change bootctl to be backed by systemd-bootd to control temporary and persistent default boot goal plus efi variables

* maybe do not install getty@tty1.service symlink in /etc but in /usr?

* re-enable "make check" for gtk-doc (broken for unknown reason)

* fstab: add new mount option x-systemd-after=/foobar/waldo to allow manual dependencies to other mount points
  https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=812826

* print a nicer explanation if people use variable/specifier expansion in ExecStart= for the first word

* mount: turn dependency information from /proc/self/mountinfo into dependency information between systemd units.

* logind:
  - logind: optionally, ignore idle-hint logic for autosuspend, block suspend as long as a session is around
  - When we update the kernel all kind of hibernation should be prohibited until shutdown/reboot
  - logind: wakelock/opportunistic suspend support
  - Add pretty name for seats in logind
  - logind: allow showing logout dialog from system?
  - we should probably handle SIGTERM/SIGINT to not leave dot files around, just in case
  - session scopes/user unit: add RequiresMountsFor for the home directory of the user
  - add Suspend() bus calls which take timestamps to fix double suspend issues when somebody hits suspend and closes laptop quickly.
  - if pam_systemd is invoked by su from a process that is outside of a
    any session we should probably just become a NOP, since that's
    usually not a real user session but just some system code that just
    needs setuid().

* exec: when deinitializating a tty device fix the perms and group, too, not only when initializing. Set access mode/gid to 0620/tty.

* service: watchdog logic: for testing purposes allow ping, but do not require pong

* journal:
  - import and delete pstore filesystem content at startup
  - journald: also get thread ID from client, plus thread name
  - journal: when waiting for journal additions in the client always sleep at least 1s or so, in order to minimize wakeups
  - add API to close/reopen/get fd for journal client fd in libsystemd-journal.
  - fallback to /dev/log based logging in libsystemd-journal, if we can't log natively?
  - declare the local journal protocol stable in the wiki interface chart
  - journal: reuse XZ context
  - sd-journal: speed up sd_journal_get_data() with transparent hash table in bg
  - journald: when dropping msgs due to ratelimit make sure to write
    "dropped %u messages" not only when we are about to print the next
    message that works, but alraedy after a short tiemout
  - check if we can make journalctl by default use --follow mode inside of less if called without args?
  - maybe add API to send pairs of iovecs via sd_journal_send
  - journal: when writing journal auto-rotate if time jumps backwards
  - journal: add a setgid "systemd-journal" utility to invoke from libsystemd-journal, which passes fds via STDOUT and does PK access
  - journactl: support negative filtering, i.e. FOOBAR!="waldo",
    and !FOOBAR for events without FOOBAR.
  - journal: send out marker messages every now and then, and immediately sync with fdatasync() afterwards, in order to have hourly guaranteed syncs.
  - journal-send.c, log.c: when the log socket is clogged, and we drop, count this and write a message about this when it gets unclogged again.
  - journal: find a way to allow dropping history early, based on priority, other rules
  - journal: When used on NFS, check payload hashes
  - journald: check whether it is OK if the client can still modify delivered journal entries
  - journal live copy, based on libneon (client) and libmicrohttpd (server)
  - journald: add kernel cmdline option to disable ratelimiting for debug purposes
  - refuse taking lower-case variable names in sd_journal_send() and friends.
  - journald: we currently rotate only after MaxUse+MaxFilesize has been reached.
  - journal: deal nicely with byte-by-byte copied files, especially regards header
  - journal: store euid in journal if it differs from uid
  - journal: sanely deal with entries which are larger than the individual file size, but where the components would fit
  - Replace utmp, wtmp, btmp, and lastlog completely with journal
  - journalctl: instead --after-cursor= maybe have a --cursor=XYZ+1 syntax?
  - tmpfiles: when applying ownership to /run/log/journal, also do this for the journal fails contained in it
  - when a kernel driver logs in a tight loop, we should ratelimit that too.
  - journald: optionally, log debug messages to /run but everything else to /var
  - journald: when we drop syslog messages because the syslog socket is
    full, make sure to write how many messages are lost as first thing
    to syslog when it works again.
  - journald: make sure ratelimit is actually really per-service with the new cgroup changes
  - change systemd-journal-flush into a service that stays around during
    boot, and causes the journal to be moved back to /run on shutdown,
    so that we don't keep /var busy. This needs to happen synchronously,
    hence doing this via signals is not going to work.

* document:
  - document that deps in [Unit] sections ignore Alias= fields in
    [Install] units of other units, unless those units are disabled
  - man: clarify that time-sync.target is not only sysv compat but also useful otherwise. Same for similar targets
  - document the exit codes when services fail before they are exec()ed
  - document that service reload may be implemented as service reexec
  - document in wiki how to map ical recurrence events to systemd timer unit calendar specifications
  - add a man page containing packaging guidelines and recommending usage of things like Documentation=, PrivateTmp=, PrivateNetwork= and ReadOnlyDirectories=/etc /usr.
  - document systemd-journal-flush.service properly
  - documentation: recommend to connect the timer units of a service to the service via Also= in [Install]
  - man: document the very specific env the shutdown drop-in tools live in
  - man: extend runlevel(8) to mention that runlevels suck, and are dead. Maybe add runlevel(7) with a note about that too
  - man: add more examples to man pages
  - man: maybe sort directives in man pages, and take sections from --help and apply them to man too

* systemctl:
  - systemctl list-jobs - show dependencies
  - add systemctl switch to dump transaction without executing it
  - Add a verbose mode to "systemctl start" and friends that explains what is being done or not done
  - "systemctl disable" on a static unit prints no message and does
    nothing. "systemctl enable" does nothing, and gives a bad message
    about it. Should fix both to print nice actionable messages.
  - print nice message from systemctl --failed if there are no entries shown, and hook that into ExecStartPre of rescue.service/emergency.service
  - add new command to systemctl: "systemctl system-reexec" which reexecs as many daemons as virtually possible
  - systemctl enable: improve the success messages (i.e. more human readable, less shell-like)
  - systemctl enable: fail if target to alias into doesn't exist? maybe show how many units are enabled afterwards?
  - systemctl: "Journal has been rotated since unit was started." message is misleading
  - support "systemctl stop foobar@.service" to stop all units matching a certain template
  - Something is wrong with symlink handling of "autovt@.service" in "systemctl list-unit-files"
  - rework wait filter to not require match callback
  - better error message if you run systemctl without systemd running
  - systemctl status output should should include list of triggering units and their status

* unit install:
  - "systemctl mask" should find all names by which a unit is accessible
    (i.e. by scanning for symlinks to it) and link them all to /dev/null
  - "systemctl disable" of a unit instance removes all symlinks, but should
    only remove the instance symlink (systemctl disable of a template
    unit however should remove them all).
  - systemctl list-unit-files should list generated files (and probably with a new state "generated" for them, or so)
  - systemctl: maybe add "systemctl add-wants" or so...

* introduce ntp.service (or suchlike) as symlink that is used to arbitrate between various NTP implementations

* deal with sendmail/postfix exclusivity

* timer units:
  - timer units should get the ability to trigger when:
    o CLOCK_REALTIME makes jumps (TFD_TIMER_CANCEL_ON_SET)
    o DST changes
  - Support 2012-02~4 as syntax for specifying the fourth to last day of the month.
  - calendarspec: support value ranges with ".." notation. Example: 2013-4..8-1
  - when parsing calendar timestamps support the UTC timezone (even if we won't support arbitrary timezone specs, support UTC itself certainly makes sense), also support syntaxes such as +0200
  - Modulate timer frequency based on battery state

* update the kernel's TZ (sys_tz) when DST changes

* sync down the system time to the RTC when:
    - CLOCK_REALTIME makes jumps (the user explicitely requested a time set)
    - DST/timezone changes && ntp is active && RTC-in-localtime (never do it without ntp)
  This takes care of syncing ntpdate updates to the RTC, and DST updates for localtime
  mode, it will never touch the RTC if the no reliable time source is active or the
  user did not request anything like it.

* libunwind support for coredump pattern hook, and includes this in
  the message for coredumps. After all, libunwind is now capable to
  unwind coredumps since a few weeks ago. This probably requires that
  we have nice support for multi-line messages on display in
  logs-show.c. Alternatively: use libelfutil, which seems to be the
  better supported alternative.

* add libsystemd-password or so to query passwords during boot using the password agent logic

* If we show an error about a unit (such as not showing up) and it has no Description string, then show a description string generated form the reverse of unit_name_mangle().

* fedup: add --unit to systemctl switch-root somehow
* fedup: don't delete initrd on switch-root
* fedup: generator

* timedated: refuse time changes when NTP is on

* clean up date formatting and parsing so that all absolute/relative timestamps we format can also be parsed

* on shutdown: move utmp, wall, audit logic all into PID 1 (or logind?), get rid of systemd-update-utmp-runlevel

* add "provisioning" instructions to setup an empty /etc + /var
    - used to setup a new container from a shared /usr
    - superset of tmpfiles model
    - instructions shipped by packages and stored in /usr/lib/
    - compose /etc/passwd and /etc/group, copy files
    - able to create uid + gid used by packages, for file ownership

* make repeated alt-ctrl-del presses printing a dump, or even force a reboot without
  waiting for the timeout

* hostnamed: before returning information from /etc/machine-info.conf check the modification data and reread. Similar for localed, ...

* currently x-systemd.timeout is lost in the initrd, since crypttab is copied into dracut, but fstab isn't

* nspawn:
  - nspawn: --read-only is not applied recursively to submounts
  - bind mount read-only the cgroup tree higher than nspawn
  - nspawn: make it work for dwalsh and shared /usr containers -- tmpfs mounts as command line parameters
  - refuses to boot containers without /etc/machine-id (OK?), and with empty /etc/machine-id (not OK).
  - support taking a btrfs snapshot at startup and dropping it afterwards
  - maybe: hookup nspawn and PrivateNetwork=yes with "ip netns"
  - generate predictable mac addresses for the netdev we create (host0), maybe based on guest's machine
    name and machine-id of host (?)

* cryptsetup:
  - cryptsetup-generator: allow specification of passwords in crypttab itself
  - move cryptsetup key caching into kernel keyctl?
    https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=54982
  - support rd.luks.allow-discards= kernel cmdline params in cryptsetup generator

* hw watchdog: optionally try to use the preset watchdog timeout instead of always overriding it
  https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=54712

* after deserializing sockets in socket.c we should reapply sockopts and things

* make timer units go away after they elapsed

* http://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/systemd-devel/2012-September/006502.html
  (network and remote-fs on shutdown)

* come up with a nice way to write queue/read_ahead_kb for a block device without interfering with readahead

* move PID 1 segfaults to /var/lib/systemd/coredump?

* create /sbin/init symlinks from the build system

* Query Paul Moore about relabelling socket fds while they are open

* allow writing multiple conditions in unit files on one line

* explore multiple service instances per listening socket idea

* MountFlags=shared acts as MountFlags=slave right now.

* ReadOnlyDirectories= is not applied recursively to submounts

* drop PID 1 reloading, only do reexecing (difficult: Reload()
  currently is properly synchronous, Reexec() is weird, because we
  can't delay the response properly until we are back, so instead of
  being properly synchronous we just keep open the fd and close it
  when done. That means clients don't get a successful method reply,
  but much rather a disconnect on success.

* properly handle loop back mounts via fstab, especially regards to fsck/passno

* allow services with no ExecStart= but with an ExecStop=

* dracut-shutdown needs to be ordered before unmounting /boot

* initialize the hostname from the fs label of /, if /etc/hostname does not exist?

* rename "userspace" to "core-os"

* load-fragment: when loading a unit file via a chain of symlinks
  verify that it isn't masked via any of the names traversed.

* introduce Type=pid-file

* change Requires=basic.target to RequisiteOverride=basic.target

* when breaking cycles drop sysv services first, then services from /run, then from /etc, then from /usr

* automount: implement expire:
   - set superblock timeout AUTOFS_DEV_IOCTL_TIMEOUT_CMD
   - periodically run AUTOFS_DEV_IOCTL_EXPIRE_CMD
     - every timeout/4 (original autofs logic)
     - blocking, needs a thread
     - run until -EAGAIN
   - receive expire packet on pipe if kernel tells the timeout is over
     - call umount
     - answer expire packet on pipe with AUTOFS_DEV_IOCTL_{READY,FAIL}_CMD
   - AUTOFS_DEV_IOCTL_EXPIRE_CMD returns

* ExecOnFailure=/usr/bin/foo

* udev:
  - remove src/udev/udev-builtin-firmware.c (CONFIG_FW_LOADER_USER_HELPER=n)
  - move to LGPL
  - kill scsi_id
  - add trigger --subsystem-match=usb/usb_device device
  - reimport udev db after MOVE events for devices without dev_t

* when a service has the same env var set twice we actually store it twice and return that in systemctl show -p... We should only show the last setting

* introduce mix of BindTo and Requisite

* add DeleteSocketsOnStop=yes|no option to socket units

* There's currently no way to cancel fsck (used to be possible via C-c or c on the console)

* add option to sockets to avoid activation. Instead just drop packets/connections, see http://cyberelk.net/tim/2012/02/15/portreserve-systemd-solution/

* default unix qlen is too small (10). bump sysctl? add sockopt?

* save coredump in Windows/Mozilla minidump format

* support crash reporting operation modes (https://live.gnome.org/GnomeOS/Design/Whiteboards/ProblemReporting)

* default to actual 32bit PIDs, via /proc/sys/kernel/pid_max

* be able to specify a forced restart of service A where service B depends on, in case B
  needs to be auto-respawned?

* when a bus name of a service disappears from the bus make sure to queue further activation requests

* tmpfiles:
  - check systemd-tmpfiles for selinux context hookup for mknod(), symlink() and similar
  - apply "x" on "D" too (see patch from William Douglas)

* for services: don't set $HOME in services unless requested

* hide PAM options in fragment parser when compile time disabled

* when we automatically restart a service, ensure we restart its rdeps, too.

* allow Type=simple with PIDFile=
  https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=723942

* move PAM code into its own binary

* implement Register= switch in .socket units to enable registration
  in Avahi, RPC and other socket registration services.

* make sure systemd-ask-password-wall does not shutdown systemd-ask-password-console too early

* support sd_notify() style notification when reload begins (RELOADING=1), reload is finished (READY=1), and add ReloadSignal= then to use in combination

* support sd_notify() style notification when shutting down, to make auto-exit bus services work (STOPPING=1)

* verify that the AF_UNIX sockets of a service in the fs still exist
  when we start a service in order to avoid confusion when a user
  assumes starting a service is enough to make it accessible

* support User= and Group= attributes for AF_UNIX sockets. (difficult, requires NSS from PID 1?)

* Make it possible to set the keymap independently from the font on
  the kernel cmdline. Right now setting one resets also the other.

* and a dbus call to generate target from current state

* readahead:
  - drop /.readahead on bigger upgrades with yum
  - move readahead files into /var (look for them with .path units?)
  - readahead: use BTRFS_IOC_DEFRAG_RANGE instead of BTRFS_IOC_DEFRAG ioctl, with START_IO
  - readahead: when bumping /sys readahead variable save mtime and compare later to detect changes
  - readahead: make use of EXT4_IOC_MOVE_EXT, as used by http://e4rat.sourceforge.net/

* add support for /bin/mount -s

* GC unreferenced jobs (such as .device jobs)

* write blog stories about:
  - hwdb: what belongs into it, lsusb
  - enabling dbus services
  - status update
  - how to make changes to sysctl and sysfs attributes
  - remote access
  - how to pass throw-away units to systemd, or dynamically change properties of existing units
  - how to integrate cgconfig and suchlike with systemd
  - testing with Harald's awesome test kit
  - auto-restart

* allow port=0 in .socket units

* support systemd.mask= on the kernel command line.

* recreate systemd's D-Bus private socket file on SIGUSR2

* Support --test based on current system state

* investigate whether the gnome pty helper should be moved into systemd, to provide cgroup support.

* maybe introduce ExecRestartPre=

* dot output for --test showing the 'initial transaction'

* fingerprint.target, wireless.target, gps.target, netdevice.target

* io priority during initialization

* drop cap bounding set in readahead and other services

* systemd-python:
   - figure out a simple way to wait for journal events in a way that
     works with ^C
   - add documentation to systemd.daemon

* bootchart:
   - plot per-process IO utilization
   - group processes based on service association (cgroups)
   - document initcall_debug
   - kernel cmdline "bootchart" option for simplicity?

* udev-link-config:
   - Make sure ID_PATH is always exported and complete for
     network devices where possible, so we can safely rely
     on Path= matching

* sd-rtnl:
   - add support for exiting containers without reading them fully first
   - add support for more attribute types

* networkd:
   - make sure RTM_NEWLINK messages match both the ifname and kind when setting the ifindex of a netdev
   - add more keys to [Route] and [Address] sections
   - add support for more DHCPv4 options (and, longer term, other kinds of dynamic config)
   - add proper initrd support (in particular generate .network/.link files based on /proc/cmdline)
   - add reduced [Link] support to .network files
   - add IPv4LL tests (inspire by DHCP)
   - add Scope= parsing option for [Network]
   - have smooth transition from LL to routable address, without disconnecting clients.

* sd-network:
   - make sure ipv4ll and dhcp clients can handle changing mac addresses while running

External:

* dbus:
   - natively watch for dbus-*.service symlinks (PENDING)
   - teach dbus to activate all services it finds in /etc/systemd/services/org-*.service

* fix alsa mixer restore to not print error when no config is stored

* make cryptsetup lower --iter-time

* patch kernel for xattr support in /dev, /proc/, /sys?

* NTP: the kernel's 11-minutes-mode syncs the system time to the RTC, but only
  in an ~30 minutes window. It does not adjust larger differences. Find a way
  to tell the kernel, to always do a full time sync when the RTC is in UTC and
  we are in 11-minutes-mode. When we trust the system time to NTP we also want
  the RTC to sync up.

* kernel: add device_type = "fb", "fbcon" to class "graphics"

* drop accountsservice's StandardOutput=syslog and Type=dbus fields

* dbus upstream still refers to dbus.target and shouldn't

* dbus: in fedora, make /var/lib/dbus/machine-id a symlink to /etc/machine-id

* add "# export SYSTEMD_PAGER=" to bash login

* /usr/bin/service should actually show the new command line

* fedora: suggest auto-restart on failure, but not on success and not on coredump. also, ask people to think about changing the start limit logic. Also point people to RestartPreventExitStatus=, SuccessExitStatus=

* fedora: F20: go timer units all the way, leave cron.daily for cron

* neither pkexec nor sudo initialize environ[] from the PAM environment?

* fedora: update policy to declare access mode and ownership of unit files to root:root 0644, and add an rpmlint check for it

Regularly:

* look for close() vs. close_nointr() vs. close_nointr_nofail()

* check for strerror(r) instead of strerror(-r)

* Use PR_SET_PROCTITLE_AREA if it becomes available in the kernel

* pahole

* set_put(), hashmap_put() return values check. i.e. == 0 doesn't free()!

* use secure_getenv() instead of getenv() where appropriate

* link up selected blog stories from man pages and unit files Documentation= fields

Scheduled for removal or fixing:

* xxxOverridable dependencies (probably: fix)
