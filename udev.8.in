.TH UDEV 8 "October 2003" "" "Linux Administrator's Manual"
.SH NAME
udev \- Linux configurable dynamic device naming support
.SH SYNOPSIS
.BI udev " hotplug-subsystem"
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.B udev
provides a dynamic device directory containing only the files for actually
present devices. It creates or removes device node files usually located in
the /dev directory, or it renames network interfaces.
.br
.P
As part of the
.B hotplug
subsystem,
.B udev
is executed if a kernel device is added or removed from the system.
On device creation,
.B udev
reads the sysfs directory of the given device to collect device attributes
like label, serial number or bus device number.
These attributes may be used as keys to determine a
unique name for the device.
.B udev
maintains a database for devices present on the system.
.br
On device removal,
.B udev
queries its database for the name of the device file to be deleted.
.SH "CONFIGURATION"
All
.B udev
configuration files consist of a set of lines of text. All empty
lines or lines beginning with '#' will be ignored.
.P
.B udev
expects its main configuration file at
.IR /etc/udev/udev.conf .
The file consists of a set of variables and values allowing the user to
override default udev values. The following variables can be overridden
in this file:
.TP
.B udev_root
Indicates where to place the device nodes in the filesystem. The default
value is
.IR @udevdir@/ .
.TP
.B udev_db
The name and location of the udev database. The default value is
.IR @udevdir@/.udevdb .
.TP
.B udev_rules
The name of the udev rules file or directory to look for files with the suffix
.IR .rules .
All rule files are read in lexical order. The default value is
.IR /etc/udev/rules.d/ .
.TP
.B udev_log
The switch to enable/disable logging of udev information
The default value is
.IR yes .
.P
.RI "A sample " udev.conf " file might look like this:
.sp
.nf
# udev_root - where to place the device nodes in the filesystem
udev_root="/udev"

# udev_db - The name and location of the udev database
udev_db="/udev/.udevdb"

# udev_rules - The name of the udev rules file or directory to look
               for files with the suffix .rules
udev_rules="/etc/udev/rules.d/"

# udev_log - set to "yes" if you want logging, else "no"
udev_log="yes"
.fi
.P
The rules for device naming are read from the files located in the
.I /etc/udev/rules.d/
directory, or at the location specified by the
.I udev_rules
value in the
.I /etc/udev/udev.conf
file.
.br
Every line in the rules file defines the mapping between device attributes
and the device name. One or more keys are specified to match a rule with
the current device. If all keys are matching, the rule will be applied and
the name is used to name the device file or the network interface.
.br
If no matching rule is found, the default kernel device name is used.
.P
Every rule consists of a list of comma separated key value fields:
.sp
.IR "key " ,[ "key " ,...]
.P
The following key names can be used to match against device properties:
.TP
.B BUS
Match the bus type of the device.
(The sysfs device bus must be able to be determined by a "device" symlink.)
.TP
.B KERNEL
Match the kernel device name.
.TP
.B SUBSYSTEM
Match the kernel subsystem name.
.TP
.B DRIVER
Match the kernel driver name.
.TP
.B ID
Match the device number on the bus, like PCI bus id.
.TP
.BI SYSFS{ filename }
Match sysfs device attribute like vendor and product id's, USB serial number
or the SCSI disk model number. Up to 5 different sysfs files can be checked,
with all of the values being required to match the rule.
.br
Trailing whitespace characters in the sysfs attribute value are ignored, if
the key doesn't have any trailing whitespace characters by itself.
.TP
.BI ENV{ variable }
Match an environment variable. Up to 5 different environment variables can be
checked, with all of the values being required to match the rule.
.TP
.B PROGRAM
Call external program. This key is valid if the program returns successful.
The environment variables of
.B udev
are also available to the program.
.br
The string returned by the program may be additionally matched with the
.B RESULT
key in the same or any later rule.
.TP
.B RESULT
Match the returned string of the last
.B PROGRAM
call. This key can be used in the same or in any later rule after a
.B PROGRAM
call.
.P
The following keys can get values assigned:
.TP
.B NAME
The name of the node to be created, or the name, the network interface
should be renamed to.
.TP
.B SYMLINK
The name of a symlink targeting the node. Multiple symlinks may be
specified by separating the names by the space character.
.br
If both the name and the symlink fields are omitted or its
values are empty, the device will be ignored and no node will be created.
.br
If only the symlink field is given and the name field is omitted,
the rule will not be applied immediately, but the symlink field is added
to the symlink list of the rule which will create the node.
This makes it possible to specify additional symlinks in a possibly
separate rules file, while the device nodes are maintained by the
distribution provided rules file.
.TP
.B OWNER, GROUP, MODE
The permissions for the device node. Every specified value overwrites the
compiled-in default value.
.TP
.B OPTIONS
.B last_rule
will be the last rule applied. No later rules will have any effect.
.sp
.B OPTIONS
.B ignore_device
will ignore this device. No node will be created.
.sp
.B ignore_remove
will ignore any later remove event for this device.
This may be useful as a workaround for broken device drivers.
.sp
.B all_partitions
will create device nodes for all available partitions of a blockdevice.
This may be useful for removable media devices which do not detect a media
change.
.sp
Multiple attributes may be separated by comma.
.P
.RB "The " NAME ", " SYMLINK ", " PROGRAM ", " OWNER " and " GROUP
fields support simple printf-like string substitutions:
.TP
.B %n
The "kernel number" of the device.
For example, 'sda3' has a "kernel number" of '3'.
.TP
.B %k
The "kernel name" for the device.
.TP
.B %p
The devpath for the device.
.TP
.B %M
The kernel major number for the device.
.TP
.B %m
The kernel minor number for the device.
.TP
.B %b
The bus id for the device.
.TP
.B %c
The string returned by the external program, specified in
.B PROGRAM
(This does not work within the
.B PROGRAM
field for the obvious reason.)
.br
A single part of the string, separated by a space character
may be selected by specifying the part number as an attribute:
.BI %c{ N }
If the number is followed by the + char this part plus
all remaining parts of the result string are substituted:
.BI %c{ N+ }
.TP
.B %N
The name of a created temporary device node to provide access to the
device from a external program.
.TP
.B %P
The node name of the parent device.
.TP
.BI %s{ filename }
The content of a sysfs attribute.
.TP
.B %e
If a device node already exists with the name, the smallest positive
decimal integer N is substituted such that the resulting name doesn't
match an existing device node. Otherwise nothing is substituted. This
can be used to create compatibility symlinks and enumerate devices of
the same type originating from different kernel subsystems.
.TP
.B %%
The '%' character itself.
.P
The count of charcters to insert may be limited by specifying
the format length value. For example, '%3s{file}' will only insert
the first three characters of the sysfs attribute.

.fi
.P
A number of different fields in the above configuration files support a simple
form of shell style pattern matching. It supports the following pattern characters:
.TP
.B *
Matches zero, one, or more characters.
.TP
.B ?
Matches any single character, but does not match zero characters.
.TP
.B [ ]
Matches any single character specified within the brackets. For example, the
pattern string "tty[SR]" would match either "ttyS" or "ttyR". Ranges are also
supported within this match with the '\-' character. For example, to match on
the range of all digits, the pattern [0\-9] would be used. If the first character
following the '[' is a '!', any characters not enclosed are matched.
.P
After device node creation, removal, or network device renaming,
.B udev
executes the programs located in the directory tree under
.IR /etc/dev.d/ .
The name of a program must have the suffix
.I .dev
to be recognized.
.br
In addition to the hotplug environment variables,
.B UDEV_LOG
is set if udev is configured to use the syslog facility. Executed programs may
want to follow that setting.
.B DEVNAME
is exported to make the name of the created node, or the name the network
device is renamed to, available to the executed program. The programs in every
directory are sorted in lexical order, while the directories are searched in
the following order:
.sp
.nf
/etc/dev.d/$(DEVNAME)/*.dev
/etc/dev.d/$(SUBSYSTEM)/*.dev
/etc/dev.d/default/*.dev
.fi
.SH "ENVIRONMENT"
.P
The following variables are read from the environment:
.TP
.B ACTION
.IR add " or " remove
signifies the addition or the removal of a device.
.TP
.B DEVPATH
The sysfs devpath of the device without the mountpoint but a leading slash.
.TP
.B SUBSYSTEM
The subsystem the device belongs to. Alternatively the subsystem may
be passed as the first argument.
.TP
.B UDEV_CONFIG_FILE
Overrides the default location of the
.B udev
config file.
.TP
.B UDEV_NO_DEVD
The default behavior of
.B udev
is to execute programs in the
.I /etc/dev.d/
directory after device handling. If set,
.B udev
will skip this step.
