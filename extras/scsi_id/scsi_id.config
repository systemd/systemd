# Informational and example scsi_id.config file for use with scsi_id. 
#

# General syntax is:
#
# lower or upper case has no affect on the left side. Quotes (") are
# required if you need spaces in values. Model is the same as the SCSI
# INQUIRY product identification field. Per the SCSI INQUIRY, the vendor
# is limited to 8 bytes, model to 16 bytes.
#
# The first maching line found is used. Short matches match longer ones,
# if you do not want such a match space fill the extra bytes. If no model
# is specified, only the vendor string need match.
#
# The "option" line is searched when scsi_id first starts up (for use with
# hotplug during boot).
#
# options=<any scsi_id command line options>
#
# vendor=string[,model=string],options=<per-device scsi_id options>

#
# If you normally don't need scsi id's, or might be attaching devices of
# an unknown functionality, black list everyone. This is the default
# behaviour (if no -b or -g is specified).
#
options=-b

#
# Then white list devices on your system that have correct and useful id's:
#
vendor=someone, model=nicedrive, options=-g

# If you all the scsi devices are your system support valid id's, remove
# the -b line above, and mark all devices as good:

## options=-g

# Then black list any offenders. Missing entries here could be dangerous
# if you rely on the id for naming or multi-path configuration!

## vendor=ELBONIA, model=borken, options=-b
