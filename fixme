* timer

* enforce max number of concurrent connection limit in sockets.

* complete dbus exposure

* make conf parser work more like .desktop parsers

* implicitly import "defaults" settings file into all types

* write .service file install tool
    [Install]
    WantedBy=graphical.target
    Names=prefdm.service

* service startup should be delayed if the matching socket is being started

* add #ifdefs for non-redhat builds in sysv parser

* add #ifdefs for non-sysv builds

* bootchart hookup

* reinvestigate random seed, hwclock

* introduce serialized mode

* "disabled" load state?

* uid are 32bit

* %m in printf() instead of strerror();

* gc: don't reap broken services

* iCalendar semantics for the timer stuff (RFC2445)

* provide sysv-like command line utilities

* ability to kill services? i.e. in contrast to stopping them, go directly
  into killing mode?

* port over to LISTEN_FDS/LISTEN_PID:

* teach dbus to talk to systemd when autospawning services

* Figure out which signal handlers we actually have to reset in the
  forked off child

* Add code to systemctl to wait for an operation to finish

* update to new libudev/tags

Regularly:

* look for close() vs. close_nointr() vs. close_nointr_nofail()

* check for strerror(r) instead of strerror(-r)
