* timer

* enforce max number of concurrent connection limit in sockets.

* complete dbus exposure

* make conf parser work more like .desktop parsers

* implicitly import "defaults" settings file into all types

* write .service file install tool
    [Install]
    WantedBy=graphical.target
    Names=prefdm.service

* service startup should be delayed if the matching socket is being started

* add #ifdefs for non-redhat builds in sysv parser

* add #ifdefs for non-sysv builds

* bootchart hookup

* reinvestigate random seed, hwclock

* introduce serialized mode

* "disabled" load state?

* uid are 32bit

* %m in printf() instead of strerror();

* gc: don't reap broken services

* iCalendar semantics for the timer stuff (RFC2445)

* provide sysv-like command line utilities

* Add OnlyByDependency

* ability to kill services? i.e. in contrast to stopping them, go directly
  into killing mode?

* port over to LISTEN_FDS/LISTEN_PID:

   - uuidd    DONE
   - nscd     DONE
   - rpcbind (/var/run/rpcbind.sock!)
   - dbus
   - rsyslog
   - cups
   - ssh      CLASSIC
   - postfix, saslauthd
   - apache/samba
   - libvirtd (/var/run/libvirt/libvirt-sock-ro)
   - bluetoothd (/var/run/sdp! @/org/bluez/audio!)
   - avahi-daemon (/var/run/avahi-daemon/socket)
   - distccd

* teach dbus to talk to systemd when autospawning services

* Figure out which signal handlers we actually have to reset in the
  forked off child

Regularly:

* look for close() vs. close_nointr() vs. close_nointr_nofail()

* check for strerror(r) instead of strerror(-r)
