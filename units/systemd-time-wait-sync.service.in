Description=Wait Until Kernel Time Synchronized
Documentation=man:systemd-time-wait-sync.service(8)

# Note that this tool doesn't need CAP_SYS_TIME itself, but its primary
# usecase is to run in conjunction with a local NTP service such as
# systemd-timesyncd.service, which is conditioned this way. There might be
# niche usecases where running this service independently is desired, but let's
# make this all "just work" for the general case, and leave it to local
# modifications to make it work in the remaining cases.
