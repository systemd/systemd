# This unit loads a specific kernel module explicitly and synchronizes on its
# initialization to be complete. This unit should only be used as dependency
# if automatic module loading cannot be used for a module, i.e. in exceptional
# cases. These cases may include:
#
# 1. The primary API exposed by the module is a device node that is normally
#    managed by systemd-tmpfiles-setup-dev-early.service (and thus auto-loading
#    is generally supported), but some service already needs the functionality
#    during even earlier boot.
#
# 2. The primary API exposed by the module is some directory in /sys/, /proc/
#    or configfs, where simple access generally is not sufficient to load the
#    module.
