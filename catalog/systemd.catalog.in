Subject: Disk space used by the journal
Defined-By: systemd
Support: %SUPPORT_URL%

@JOURNAL_NAME@ (@JOURNAL_PATH@) is currently using @CURRENT_USE_PRETTY@.
Maximum allowed usage is set to @MAX_USE_PRETTY@.
Leaving at least @DISK_KEEP_FREE_PRETTY@ free (of currently available @DISK_AVAILABLE_PRETTY@ of disk space).
Enforced usage limit is thus @LIMIT_PRETTY@, of which @AVAILABLE_PRETTY@ are still available.

The limits controlling how much disk space is used by the journal may
be configured with SystemMaxUse=, SystemKeepFree=, SystemMaxFileSize=,
RuntimeMaxUse=, RuntimeKeepFree=, RuntimeMaxFileSize= settings in
/etc/systemd/journald.conf. See journald.conf(5) for details.

Subject: Failed to generate valid unit name from path '@MOUNT_POINT@'.
Defined-By: systemd
Support: %SUPPORT_URL%

The following mount point path could not be converted into a valid .mount
unit name:

    @MOUNT_POINT@

Typically this means that the path to the mount point is longer than allowed
for valid unit names.

systemd dynamically synthesizes .mount units for all mount points appearing on
the system. For that a simple escaping algorithm is applied: the absolute path
name is used, with all "/" characters replaced by "-" (the leading one is
removed). Moreover, any non-alphanumeric characters (as well as any of ":",
"-", "_", ".", "\") are replaced by "\xNN" where "NN" is the hexadecimal code
of the character. Finally, ".mount" is suffixed. The resulting string must be
under 256 characters in length to be a valid unit name. This restriction is
made in order for all unit names to also be suitable as file names. If a mount
point appears that — after escaping — is longer than this limit it cannot be
mapped to a unit. In this case systemd will refrain from synthesizing a unit
and cannot be used to manage the mount point. It will not appear in the service
manager's unit table and thus also not be torn down safely and automatically at
system shutdown.

It is generally recommended to avoid such overly long mount point paths, or —
if used anyway – manage them independently of systemd, i.e. establish them as
well as tear them down automatically at system shutdown by other software.

Support: %SUPPORT_URL%
Documentation: https://systemd.io/UIDS-GIDS

The unit @UNIT@ is configured to use User=@OFFENDING_USER@.

This is not safe. The @OFFENDING_USER@ user's main purpose on Linux-based
operating systems is to be the owner of files that otherwise cannot be mapped
to any local user. It's used by the NFS client and Linux user namespacing,
among others. By running a unit's processes under the identity of this user
they might possibly get read and even write access to such files that cannot
otherwise be mapped.

It is strongly recommended to avoid running services under this user identity,
in particular on systems using NFS or running containers. Allocate a user ID
specific to this service, either statically via systemd-sysusers or dynamically
via the DynamicUser= service setting.

guarantees other subsystems traditionally assumed it provides. Relying on this
service is racy, and it is generally a bug to make use of it and depend on it.

Traditionally, this service's job was to wait until all devices a system
possesses have been fully probed and initialized, delaying boot until this
phase is completed. However, today's systems and hardware generally don't work
this way anymore, hardware today may show up any time and take any time to be
probed and initialized. Thus, in the general case, it's no longer possible to
correctly delay boot until "all devices" have been processed, as it is not
clear what "all devices" means and when they have been found. This is in
particular the case if USB hardware or network-attached hardware is used.

Modern software that requires some specific hardware (such as a network device
or block device) to operate should only wait for the specific devices it needs
to show up, and otherwise operate asynchronously initializing devices as they
appear during boot and during runtime without delaying the boot process.

It is a defect of the software in question if it doesn't work this way, and
still pulls systemd-udev-settle.service into the boot process.

Please file a bug report against the following units, with a request for it to
be updated to operate in a hotplug fashion without depending on
systemd-udev-settle.service:

Memory of process @_PID@ (@_COMM@) has been trimmed.

Either on user request or as result of a memory pressure event, memory of the
process has been trimmed, returning unneeded allocation caches and other
resources back to the OS kernel, making them available for other components of
the OS.

@TRIMMED_BYTES@ of memory were returned to the OS, which took @TRIMMED_USEC@
micro-seconds (μs).

Subject: SysV Service Found
Defined-By: systemd
Support: %SUPPORT_URL%

A System V service script @SYSVSCRIPT@ has been found on the system that lacks
a native systemd unit. An automatic unit file @UNIT@ has been generated for
compatibility.

Note that these automatically generated compatibility unit files cannot replace
native unit files as they generally slow down the system (by creating
unnecessary, additional synchronization points), are less robust (as SysV services
cannot properly be lifecycle tracked or automatically restarted) and less
secure (as no sandboxing restrictions can be enforced).

Compatibility support for System V services in systemd is deprecated. Please
make sure to update the package in question to provide proper, native systemd
unit files. Contact vendor if necessary. Compatibility support for System V
services is deprecated and will be removed soon.

Documentation: man:systemd-tpm2-setup.service(8)

An authorization failure occurred while attempting to enroll a Storage Root Key
(SRK) on the Trusted Platform Module (TPM). Most likely this means that a
PIN/Password (authValue) has been set on the Owner hierarchy of the TPM.

Automatic SRK enrollment on TPMs in such scenarios is not supported. In order
to unset the PIN/password protection on the owner hierarchy issue a command
like the following: 'tpm2_changeauth -c o -p <OLDPW> ""'.

Subject: TPM clear requested
Defined-By: systemd
Support: %SUPPORT_URL%
Documentation: man:systemd-tpm2-clear.service(8)

A request to clear the TPM security chip has been issued to the firmware. This
is typically done as part of a comprehensive factory reset operation, and
ensures that on the next boot process the firmware will reset the TPM, after
interactively requesting confirmation by the user.

Clearing the TPM has the effect of invalidating all keys locked to the TPM,
including full disk encryption keys. Because of that care should be taken that
access to relevant resources is retained via other means.

A kernel device @DEVICE@ has been encountered whose identification cannot be
turned into a valid systemd unit name. This typically indicates a problematic
device hierarchy (i.e. too deep nesting of buses) or drivers.

For devices like this no .device unit will be created that follows the
underlying kernel device's state, and hence no dependencies on such a unit can
be fulfilled.

Subject: Unit ordering cycle found
Defined-By: systemd
Support: %SUPPORT_URL%
Documentation: man:systemd(1)

A unit transaction was initiated that contains an ordering cycle, i.e. some
unit that was requested to be started (either directly, or inderectly due to a
requirement dependency such as Wants= or Requires=) is ordered before some
other unit (via After=/Before=), but that latter unit is also ordered before
the former by some dependency (either directly or indirectly).

Ordering cycles consist of at least two units, but might involve many
more. They generally indicate a bug in the unit definitions, as a unit
conceptually cannot be run both before and after some other unit, it must be
strictly ordered either before or after.

The ordering cycle is shown in the log message. An attempt will be made to
remove unit jobs from the transaction in order to make the transaction succeed
at least partially. Note that such cycle breaking is not going to correct the
issue, it is just an attempt to make the outcome less problematic.

The correct fix is to analyze the cycle in question and then break the cycle at
the right place by removing the right After= or Before= lines from one or more
of the involved unit files.

In order to address an ordering cycle between units that have been added to a
transaction a job has been removed from the transaction.

The removed job is '@DELETED_TYPE@' for unit @DELETED_UNIT@.

The removal of the job is done in order to minimize the negative effect of an
ordering cycle — it is not going to fix the underlying problem, which is a bug
in the involved unit files. The deleted job might be fundamental for the other
units in the transaction to operate, which hence might fail.
