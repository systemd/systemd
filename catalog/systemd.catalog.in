Subject: Disk space used by the journal
Defined-By: systemd
Support: %SUPPORT_URL%

@JOURNAL_NAME@ (@JOURNAL_PATH@) is currently using @CURRENT_USE_PRETTY@.
Maximum allowed usage is set to @MAX_USE_PRETTY@.
Leaving at least @DISK_KEEP_FREE_PRETTY@ free (of currently available @DISK_AVAILABLE_PRETTY@ of disk space).
Enforced usage limit is thus @LIMIT_PRETTY@, of which @AVAILABLE_PRETTY@ are still available.

The limits controlling how much disk space is used by the journal may
be configured with SystemMaxUse=, SystemKeepFree=, SystemMaxFileSize=,
RuntimeMaxUse=, RuntimeKeepFree=, RuntimeMaxFileSize= settings in
/etc/systemd/journald.conf. See journald.conf(5) for details.

Subject: Failed to generate valid unit name from path '@MOUNT_POINT@'.
Defined-By: systemd
Support: %SUPPORT_URL%

The following mount point path could not be converted into a valid .mount
unit name:

    @MOUNT_POINT@

Typically this means that the path to the mount point is longer than allowed
for valid unit names.

systemd dynamically synthesizes .mount units for all mount points appearing on
the system. For that a simple escaping algorithm is applied: the absolute path
name is used, with all "/" characters replaced by "-" (the leading one is
removed). Moreover, any non-alphanumeric characters (as well as any of ":",
"-", "_", ".", "\") are replaced by "\xNN" where "NN" is the hexadecimal code
of the character. Finally, ".mount" is suffixed. The resulting string must be
under 256 characters in length to be a valid unit name. This restriction is
made in order for all unit names to also be suitable as file names. If a mount
point appears that — after escaping — is longer than this limit it cannot be
mapped to a unit. In this case systemd will refrain from synthesizing a unit
and cannot be used to manage the mount point. It will not appear in the service
manager's unit table and thus also not be torn down safely and automatically at
system shutdown.

It is generally recommended to avoid such overly long mount point paths, or —
if used anyway – manage them independently of systemd, i.e. establish them as
well as tear them down automatically at system shutdown by other software.

Support: %SUPPORT_URL%
Documentation: https://systemd.io/UIDS-GIDS

The unit @UNIT@ is configured to use User=@OFFENDING_USER@.

This is not safe. The @OFFENDING_USER@ user's main purpose on Linux-based
operating systems is to be the owner of files that otherwise cannot be mapped
to any local user. It's used by the NFS client and Linux user namespacing,
among others. By running a unit's processes under the identity of this user
they might possibly get read and even write access to such files that cannot
otherwise be mapped.

It is strongly recommended to avoid running services under this user identity,
in particular on systems using NFS or running containers. Allocate a user ID
specific to this service, either statically via systemd-sysusers or dynamically
via the DynamicUser= service setting.

Subject: systemd-udev-settle.service is deprecated.
Defined-By: systemd
Support: %SUPPORT_URL%

Usage of the systemd service unit systemd-udev-settle.service is deprecated. It
inserts artificial delays into the boot process without providing the
guarantees other subsystems traditionally assumed it provides. Relying on this
service is racy, and it is generally a bug to make use of it and depend on it.

Traditionally, this service's job was to wait until all devices a system
possesses have been fully probed and initialized, delaying boot until this
phase is completed. However, today's systems and hardware generally don't work
this way anymore, hardware today may show up any time and take any time to be
probed and initialized. Thus, in the general case, it's no longer possible to
correctly delay boot until "all devices" have been processed, as it is not
clear what "all devices" means and when they have been found. This is in
particular the case if USB hardware or network-attached hardware is used.

Modern software that requires some specific hardware (such as a network device
or block device) to operate should only wait for the specific devices it needs
to show up, and otherwise operate asynchronously initializing devices as they
appear during boot and during runtime without delaying the boot process.

It is a defect of the software in question if it doesn't work this way, and
still pulls systemd-udev-settle.service into the boot process.

Please file a bug report against the following units, with a request for it to
be updated to operate in a hotplug fashion without depending on
systemd-udev-settle.service:

For the first time during the current boot an NTP synchronization has been
acquired and the local system clock adjustment has been initiated.

Subject: TPM PCR Extended
Defined-By: systemd
Support: %SUPPORT_URL%

The Trusted Platform Module's (TPM) Platform Configuration Register (PCR)
@PCR@, on banks @BANKS@, has been extended with the string '@MEASURING@'.

Whenever the system transitions to a new runtime phase, the specified PCR is
extended with a different string, to ensure that security policies for
TPM-bound secrets and other resources are limited to specific phases of the
runtime.

Subject: Memory Trimmed
Defined-By: systemd
Support: %SUPPORT_URL%

Memory of process @_PID@ (@_COMM@) has been trimmed.

Either on user request or as result of a memory pressure event, memory of the
process has been trimmed, returning unneeded allocation caches and other
resources back to the OS kernel, making them available for other components of
the OS.

@TRIMMED_BYTES@ of memory were returned to the OS, which took @TRIMMED_USEC@
micro-seconds (μs).

Subject: SysV Service Found
Defined-By: systemd
Support: %SUPPORT_URL%

A System V service script @SYSVSCRIPT@ has been found on the system that lacks
a native systemd unit. An automatic unit file @UNIT@ has been generated for
compatibility.

Note that these automatically generated compatibility unit files cannot replace
native unit files as they generally slow down the system (by creating
unnecessary, additional synchronization points), are less robust (as SysV services
cannot properly be lifecycle tracked or automatically restarted) and less
secure (as no sandboxing restrictions can be enforced).

Compatibility support for System V services in systemd is deprecated. Please
make sure to update the package in question to provide proper, native systemd
unit files. Contact vendor if necessary. Compatibility support for System V
services is deprecated and will be removed soon.

A new Portable Service @PORTABLE_ROOT@ (with extensions: @PORTABLE_EXTENSION@) has

Subject: Authorization failure while attempting to enroll SRK into TPM
Defined-By: systemd
Support: %SUPPORT_URL%
Documentation: man:systemd-tpm2-setup.service(8)

An authorization failure occurred while attempting to enroll a Storage Root Key
(SRK) on the Trusted Platform Module (TPM). Most likely this means that a
PIN/Password (authValue) has been set on the Owner hierarchy of the TPM.

Automatic SRK enrollment on TPMs in such scenarios is not supported. In order
to unset the PIN/password protection on the owner hierarchy issue a command
like the following: 'tpm2_changeauth -c o -p <OLDPW> ""'.

Subject: A foreign process changed a sysctl systemd-networkd manages
Defined-By: systemd
Support: %SUPPORT_URL%

The sysctl configuration setting @SYSCTL@, which is managed by
systemd-networkd, has been changed by another, unrelated process
("@OBJECT_COMM@", PID @OBJECT_PID@). This represents a conflict of ownership
and will likely result in problems later on.

Value changed to "@NEWVALUE@", which should be "@OURVALUE@".
