The systemd project is governed as a Free Software project, with the following rules:

1. Anyone is welcome to submit comments and reviews.

2. Every project maintainer has the right to merge changes, if they feel that
   they hold the expertise in the specific area.

3. Except for trivial changes, an approval from at least one project maintainer
   who is not the author is required before merging.

4. Regular contributors may be invited to join the project maintainers team.

5. If there's disagreement whether technical changes should be merged or not,
   and attempts to resolve the situation amicably didn't result in a solution,
   the subsystem maintainer makes the final decision. If a subsystem has no
   specific maintainer, then the project leader has the final say.

6. Changes to the list of maintainers or this governance document require a
   simple majority vote of all maintainers.
