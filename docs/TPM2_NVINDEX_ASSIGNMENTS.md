# TPM 2.0 NV Index Assignments

The Trusted Computing Group (TCG) maintains a [Registry of Reserved TPM 2.0
Handles and Localities](https://trustedcomputinggroup.org/resource/registry/)
which assigns TPM 2.0 NV index ranges (among ther things, see section 2.2) to
organizations (by convention only!). It has assigned the NV index range
**0x01800400-0x018005FF** to the systemd project. This NV index range is subdivided
and used by systemd for the following purposes:

## As Storage for a Disk Encryption PolicyAuthorizeNV Policy Hash

*Scope*: Dynamic allocation at OS installation time, one for each installed
Linux/systemd based OS that uses `systemd-pcrlock` based disk encryption policies.

*Subrange*: **0x01800400-0x0180041F**

*Number of NV Indexes*: **32**

*Size*: Stores one policy hash. Under the assumption SHA256 policy hashes are
used, this means **32 byte**.

## As Storage for Additional PCRs Implemented in NV Indexes

*Scope*: Static allocation by the systemd project, one for each additional NV
Indexed based PCR (systemd calls these "NvPCRs"). These can be shared between
multiple Linux/systemd based OSes installed on the same system.

*Subrange*: **0x01800420-0x01800423**

*Number of NV Indexes*: **4**

*Size*: Stores one PCR hash each (`TPMA_NT_EXTEND`). We'd expect that typically
SHA256 PCR hashes are used, hence this means **32 byte**.

*Detailed Assignments*:

|    NVIndex | Purpose                                                       |
|------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| 0x01800420 | Used LUKS unlock mechanism (TPM2, PKCS11, FIDO2, â€¦)           |
| 0x01800421 | Product UUID                                                  |
| 0x01800422 | System Extension Images (sysexts) applied to the host         |
| 0x01800423 | Configuration Extension Images (confexts) applied to the host |

## Currently Unused Range

The following range is currently not used by the systemd project, but might be
allocated later: **0x01800424-0x018005FF**

## Summary:

|         NVIndex Range | Number | Purpose                                        |
|-----------------------|--------|------------------------------------------------|
| 0x01800400-0x0180041F | 32     | Assigned to systemd, used for pcrlock policies |
| 0x01800420-0x01800423 | 4      | Assigned to systemd, used as additional PCRs   |
| 0x01800424-0x018005FF | 476    | Assigned to systemd, currently unused          |
