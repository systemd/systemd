   systemd — init — systemd system and service manager
   ###################################################

   Synopsis
   ########

``/usr/lib/systemd/systemd`` [OPTIONS...], ``init`` [OPTIONS...] {COMMAND}

Description
===========

systemd is a system and service manager for Linux operating systems. When run as first process on
boot (as PID 1), it acts as init system that brings up and maintains userspace services. Separate
instances are started for logged-in users to start their services.

``systemd`` is usually not invoked directly by the user, but is installed as the
``/sbin/init`` symlink and started during early boot. The user manager instances are
started automatically through the
:ref:`user@.service(5)`
service.

For compatibility with SysV, if the binary is called as ``init`` and is not the
first process on the machine (PID is not 1), it will execute ``telinit`` and pass all
command line arguments unmodified. That means ``init`` and ``telinit`` are
mostly equivalent when invoked from normal login sessions. See
:ref:`telinit(8)` for more
information.

When run as a system instance, systemd interprets the
configuration file ``system.conf`` and the files
in ``system.conf.d`` directories; when run as a
user instance, systemd interprets the configuration file
``user.conf`` and the files in
``user.conf.d`` directories. See
:ref:`systemd-system.conf(5)`
for more information.

``systemd`` contains native implementations of various tasks that need to be
executed as part of the boot process. For example, it sets the hostname or configures the loopback
network device. It also sets up and mounts various API file systems, such as ``/sys/``,
``/proc/``, and ``/dev/``.

``systemd`` will also reset the system clock during early boot if it appears to be
set incorrectly. See "System clock epoch" section below.

Note that some but not all interfaces provided by systemd are covered by the
`Interface Portability and Stability Promise <https://systemd.io/PORTABILITY_AND_STABILITY/>`_.

The D-Bus API of ``systemd`` is described in
:ref:`org.freedesktop.systemd1(5)`
and
:ref:`org.freedesktop.LogControl1(5)`.

Systems which invoke systemd in a container or initrd environment should implement the `Container Interface <https://systemd.io/CONTAINER_INTERFACE>`_ or
`initrd Interface <https://systemd.io/INITRD_INTERFACE/>`_
specifications, respectively.

Units
=====

systemd provides a dependency system between various
entities called "units" of 11 different types. Units encapsulate
various objects that are relevant for system boot-up and
maintenance. The majority of units are configured in unit
configuration files, whose syntax and basic set of options is
described in
:ref:`systemd.unit(5)`,
however some are created automatically from other configuration
files, dynamically from system state or programmatically at runtime.
Units may be "active" (meaning started, bound, plugged in, …,
depending on the unit type, see below), or "inactive" (meaning
stopped, unbound, unplugged, …), as well as in the process of
being activated or deactivated, i.e. between the two states (these
states are called "activating", "deactivating"). A special
"failed" state is available as well, which is very similar to
"inactive" and is entered when the service failed in some way
(process returned error code on exit, or crashed, an operation
timed out, or after too many restarts). If this state is entered,
the cause will be logged, for later reference. Note that the
various unit types may have a number of additional substates,
which are mapped to the five generalized unit states described
here.

The following unit types are available:

1. Service units, which start and control daemons
  and the processes they consist of. For details, see
  :ref:`systemd.service(5)`.
  Socket units, which encapsulate local IPC or
  network sockets in the system, useful for socket-based
  activation. For details about socket units, see
  :ref:`systemd.socket(5)`,
  for details on socket-based activation and other forms of
  activation, see
  :ref:`daemon(7)`.
  Target units are useful to group units, or
  provide well-known synchronization points during boot-up, see
  :ref:`systemd.target(5)`.
  Device units expose kernel devices in systemd
  and may be used to implement device-based activation. For
  details, see
  :ref:`systemd.device(5)`.
  Mount units control mount points in the file
  system, for details see
  :ref:`systemd.mount(5)`.
  Automount units provide automount capabilities,
  for on-demand mounting of file systems as well as parallelized
  boot-up. See
  :ref:`systemd.automount(5)`.
  Timer units are useful for triggering activation
  of other units based on timers. You may find details in
  :ref:`systemd.timer(5)`.
  Swap units are very similar to mount units and
  encapsulate memory swap partitions or files of the operating
  system. They are described in
  :ref:`systemd.swap(5)`.
  Path units may be used to activate other
  services when file system objects change or are modified. See
  :ref:`systemd.path(5)`.
  Slice units may be used to group units which
  manage system processes (such as service and scope units) in a
  hierarchical tree for resource management purposes. See
  :ref:`systemd.slice(5)`.
  Scope units are similar to service units, but
  manage foreign processes instead of starting them as well. See
  :ref:`systemd.scope(5)`.

Units are named as their configuration files. Some units
have special semantics. A detailed list is available in
:ref:`systemd.special(7)`.

systemd knows various kinds of dependencies, including
positive and negative requirement dependencies (i.e.
``Requires=`` and ``Conflicts=``) as
well as ordering dependencies (``After=`` and
``Before=``). NB: ordering and requirement
dependencies are orthogonal. If only a requirement dependency
exists between two units (e.g. ``foo.service``
requires ``bar.service``), but no ordering
dependency (e.g. ``foo.service`` after
``bar.service``) and both are requested to start,
they will be started in parallel. It is a common pattern that both
requirement and ordering dependencies are placed between two
units. Also note that the majority of dependencies are implicitly
created and maintained by systemd. In most cases, it should be
unnecessary to declare additional dependencies manually, however
it is possible to do this.

Application programs and units (via dependencies) may
request state changes of units. In systemd, these requests are
encapsulated as 'jobs' and maintained in a job queue. Jobs may
succeed or can fail, their execution is ordered based on the
ordering dependencies of the units they have been scheduled
for.

On boot systemd activates the target unit
``default.target`` whose job is to activate
on-boot services and other on-boot units by pulling them in via
dependencies. Usually, the unit name is just an alias (symlink) for
either ``graphical.target`` (for fully-featured
boots into the UI) or ``multi-user.target`` (for
limited console-only boots for use in embedded or server
environments, or similar; a subset of graphical.target). However,
it is at the discretion of the administrator to configure it as an
alias to any other target unit. See
:ref:`systemd.special(7)`
for details about these target units.

On first boot, ``systemd`` will enable or disable units according to preset policy.
See :ref:`systemd.preset(5)`
and "First Boot Semantics" in
:ref:`machine-id(5)`.

systemd only keeps a minimal set of units loaded into memory. Specifically, the only units that are
kept loaded into memory are those for which at least one of the following conditions is true:

1. It is in an active, activating, deactivating or failed state (i.e. in any unit state except for "inactive")
  It has a job queued for it
  It is a dependency of at least one other unit that is loaded into memory
  It has some form of resource still allocated (e.g. a service unit that is inactive but for which
  a process is still lingering that ignored the request to be terminated)
  It has been pinned into memory programmatically by a D-Bus call

systemd will automatically and implicitly load units from disk — if they are not loaded yet — as soon as
operations are requested for them. Thus, in many respects, the fact whether a unit is loaded or not is invisible to
clients. Use ``systemctl list-units --all`` to comprehensively list all units currently loaded. Any
unit for which none of the conditions above applies is promptly unloaded. Note that when a unit is unloaded from
memory its accounting data is flushed out too. However, this data is generally not lost, as a journal log record
is generated declaring the consumed resources whenever a unit shuts down.

Processes systemd spawns are placed in individual Linux control groups named after the unit which
they belong to in the private systemd hierarchy. (see `Control Groups v2 <https://docs.kernel.org/admin-guide/cgroup-v2.html>`_ for more information
about control groups, or short "cgroups").  systemd uses this to effectively keep track of
processes. Control group information is maintained in the kernel, and is accessible via the file system
hierarchy (beneath ``/sys/fs/cgroup/``), or in tools such as :man-pages:`systemd-cgls(1)` or
:man-pages:`ps(1)` (``ps
xawf -eo pid,user,cgroup,args`` is particularly useful to list all processes and the systemd
units they belong to.).

systemd is compatible with the SysV init system to a large
degree: SysV init scripts are supported and simply read as an
alternative (though limited) configuration file format. The SysV
``/dev/initctl`` interface is provided, and
compatibility implementations of the various SysV client tools are
available. In addition to that, various established Unix
functionality such as ``/etc/fstab`` or the
``utmp`` database are supported.

systemd has a minimal transaction system: if a unit is
requested to start up or shut down it will add it and all its
dependencies to a temporary transaction. Then, it will verify if
the transaction is consistent (i.e. whether the ordering of all
units is cycle-free). If it is not, systemd will try to fix it up,
and removes non-essential jobs from the transaction that might
remove the loop. Also, systemd tries to suppress non-essential
jobs in the transaction that would stop a running service. Finally
it is checked whether the jobs of the transaction contradict jobs
that have already been queued, and optionally the transaction is
aborted then. If all worked out and the transaction is consistent
and minimized in its impact it is merged with all already
outstanding jobs and added to the run queue. Effectively this
means that before executing a requested operation, systemd will
verify that it makes sense, fixing it if possible, and only
failing if it really cannot work.

Note that transactions are generated independently of a unit's
state at runtime, hence, for example, if a start job is requested on an
already started unit, it will still generate a transaction and wake up any
inactive dependencies (and cause propagation of other jobs as per the
defined relationships). This is because the enqueued job is at the time of
execution compared to the target unit's state and is marked successful and
complete when both satisfy. However, this job also pulls in other
dependencies due to the defined relationships and thus leads to, in our
example, start jobs for any of those inactive units getting queued as
well.

Units may be generated dynamically at boot and system
manager reload time, for example based on other configuration
files or parameters passed on the kernel command line. For details, see
:ref:`systemd.generator(7)`.

Directories
===========

``System unit directories``
---------------------------

The systemd system manager reads unit
configuration from various directories. Packages that want to
install unit files shall place them in the directory returned
by ``pkg-config systemd
--variable=systemdsystemunitdir``. Other directories
checked are ``/usr/local/lib/systemd/system``
and ``/usr/lib/systemd/system``. User
configuration always takes precedence. ``pkg-config
systemd --variable=systemdsystemconfdir`` returns the
path of the system configuration directory. Packages should
alter the content of these directories only with the
``enable`` and ``disable``
commands of the
:ref:`systemctl(1)`
tool. Full list of directories is provided in
:ref:`systemd.unit(5)`.

``User unit directories``
-------------------------

Similar rules apply for the user unit
directories. However, here the
`XDG
Base Directory specification <https://standards.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/basedir-spec-latest.html>`_ is followed to find
units. Applications should place their unit files in the
directory returned by ``pkg-config systemd
--variable=systemduserunitdir``. Global configuration
is done in the directory reported by ``pkg-config
systemd --variable=systemduserconfdir``. The
``enable`` and ``disable``
commands of the
:ref:`systemctl(1)`
tool can handle both global (i.e. for all users) and private
(for one user) enabling/disabling of units. Full list of
directories is provided in
:ref:`systemd.unit(5)`.

``SysV init scripts directory``
-------------------------------

The location of the SysV init script directory
varies between distributions. If systemd cannot find a native
unit file for a requested service, it will look for a SysV
init script of the same name (with the
``.service`` suffix
removed).

``SysV runlevel link farm directory``
-------------------------------------

The location of the SysV runlevel link farm
directory varies between distributions. systemd will take the
link farm into account when figuring out whether a service
shall be enabled. Note that a service unit with a native unit
configuration file cannot be started by activating it in the
SysV runlevel link farm.

Signals
=======

The service listens to various UNIX process signals that can be used to request various actions
asynchronously. The signal handling is enabled very early during boot, before any further processes are
invoked. However, a supervising container manager or similar that intends to request these operations via
this mechanism must take into consideration that this functionality is not available during the earliest
initialization phase. An sd_notify() notification message carrying the
``X_SYSTEMD_SIGNALS_LEVEL=2`` field is emitted once the signal handlers are enabled, see
below. This may be used to schedule submission of these signals correctly.

``SIGTERM``
-----------

Upon receiving this signal the systemd system
manager serializes its state, reexecutes itself and
deserializes the saved state again. This is mostly equivalent
to ``systemctl daemon-reexec``.

systemd user managers will start the
``exit.target`` unit when this signal is
received. This is mostly equivalent to ``systemctl
--user start exit.target
--job-mode=replace-irreversibly``.

``SIGINT``
----------

Upon receiving this signal the systemd system manager will start the
``ctrl-alt-del.target`` unit. This is mostly equivalent to
``systemctl start ctrl-alt-del.target --job-mode=replace-irreversibly``. If
this signal is received more than 7 times per 2s, an immediate reboot is triggered. Note
that pressing
:kbd:`Ctrl` + :kbd:`Alt` + :kbd:`Del` on the
console will trigger this signal. Hence, if a reboot is hanging, pressing
:kbd:`Ctrl` + :kbd:`Alt` + :kbd:`Del` more than
7 times in 2 seconds is a relatively safe way to trigger an immediate reboot.

systemd user managers treat this signal the same way as
``SIGTERM``.

``SIGWINCH``
------------

When this signal is received the systemd
system manager will start the
``kbrequest.target`` unit. This is mostly
equivalent to ``systemctl start
kbrequest.target``.

This signal is ignored by systemd user
managers.

``SIGPWR``
----------

When this signal is received the systemd
manager will start the ``sigpwr.target``
unit. This is mostly equivalent to ``systemctl start
sigpwr.target``.

``SIGUSR1``
-----------

When this signal is received the systemd
manager will try to reconnect to the D-Bus
bus.

``SIGUSR2``
-----------

When this signal is received the systemd
manager will log its complete state in human-readable form.
The data logged is the same as printed by
``systemd-analyze dump``.

``SIGHUP``
----------

Reloads the complete daemon configuration.
This is mostly equivalent to ``systemctl
daemon-reload``.

``SIGRTMIN+0``
--------------

Enters default mode, starts the
``default.target`` unit. This is mostly
equivalent to ``systemctl isolate
default.target``.

``SIGRTMIN+1``
--------------

Enters rescue mode, starts the
``rescue.target`` unit. This is mostly
equivalent to ``systemctl isolate
rescue.target``.

``SIGRTMIN+2``
--------------

Enters emergency mode, starts the
``emergency.service`` unit. This is mostly
equivalent to ``systemctl isolate
emergency.service``.

``SIGRTMIN+3``
--------------

Halts the machine, starts the
``halt.target`` unit. This is mostly
equivalent to ``systemctl start halt.target
--job-mode=replace-irreversibly``.

``SIGRTMIN+4``
--------------

Powers off the machine, starts the
``poweroff.target`` unit. This is mostly
equivalent to ``systemctl start poweroff.target
--job-mode=replace-irreversibly``.

``SIGRTMIN+5``
--------------

Reboots the machine, starts the
``reboot.target`` unit. This is mostly
equivalent to ``systemctl start reboot.target
--job-mode=replace-irreversibly``.

``SIGRTMIN+6``
--------------

Reboots the machine via kexec, starts the
``kexec.target`` unit. This is mostly
equivalent to ``systemctl start kexec.target
--job-mode=replace-irreversibly``.

``SIGRTMIN+7``
--------------

Reboots userspace, starts the ``soft-reboot.target`` unit. This is
mostly equivalent to ``systemctl start soft-reboot.target
--job-mode=replace-irreversibly``.

``systemd.log_level=debug`` on the kernel command line.

``SIGRTMIN+23``
---------------

Environment
===========

The environment block for the system manager is initially set by the kernel. (In particular,
"key=value" assignments on the kernel command line are turned into environment
variables for PID 1). For the user manager, the system manager sets the environment as described in the
"Environment Variables in Spawned Processes" section of
:ref:`systemd.exec(5)`. The
``DefaultEnvironment=`` setting in the system manager applies to all services including
``user@.service``. Additional entries may be configured (as for any other service)
through the ``Environment=`` and ``EnvironmentFile=`` settings for
``user@.service`` (see
:ref:`systemd.exec(5)`). Also,
additional environment variables may be set through the ``ManagerEnvironment=`` setting in
:ref:`systemd-system.conf(5)`
and
:ref:`systemd-user.conf(5)`.

configuration.

``$SYSTEMD_UNIT_PATH, $SYSTEMD_GENERATOR_PATH, $SYSTEMD_ENVIRONMENT_GENERATOR_PATH``
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Controls where systemd looks for unit files and
generators.

These variables may contain a list of paths, separated by colons
(":"). When set, if the list ends with an empty
component ("...:"), this list is prepended to the
usual set of paths. Otherwise, the specified list replaces the usual

``$LISTEN_PID, $LISTEN_FDS, $LISTEN_FDNAMES``
---------------------------------------------

Set by systemd for supervised processes during
socket-based activation. See
:ref:`sd_listen_fds(3)`
for more information.

``$NOTIFY_SOCKET``
------------------

Set by service manager for its services for status and readiness notifications. Also
consumed by service manager for notifying supervising container managers or service managers up the
stack about its own progress. See
:ref:`sd_notify(3)` and the
relevant section below for more information.

For further environment variables understood by systemd and its various components, see `Known Environment Variables <https://systemd.io/ENVIRONMENT>`_.

Kernel Command Line
===================

When run as the system instance, systemd parses a number of options listed below. They can be
specified as kernel command line arguments which are parsed from a number of sources depending on the
environment in which systemd is executed. If run inside a Linux container, these options are parsed from
the command line arguments passed to systemd itself, next to any of the command line options listed in
the Options section above. If run outside of Linux containers, these arguments are parsed from
``/proc/cmdline`` and from the "SystemdOptions" EFI variable
(on EFI systems) instead. Options from ``/proc/cmdline`` have higher priority.

Note: use of "SystemdOptions" is deprecated.

The following variables are understood:

``systemd.unit=, rd.systemd.unit=``
-----------------------------------

Overrides the unit to activate on boot.  Defaults to
``default.target``. This may be used to temporarily boot into a different boot unit,
for example ``rescue.target`` or ``emergency.service``. See
:ref:`systemd.special(7)`
for details about these units. The option prefixed with "rd." is honored only in the
initrd, while the one that is not prefixed only in the main system.

``systemd.dump_core``
---------------------

Takes a boolean argument or enables the option if specified
without an argument. If enabled, the systemd manager (PID 1) dumps core when
it crashes. Otherwise, no core dump is created. Defaults to enabled.

.. only:: html

   .. versionadded:: 233

``systemd.crash_chvt``
----------------------

Takes a positive integer, or a boolean argument. Can be also specified without an
argument, with the same effect as a positive boolean. If a positive integer (in the range 1–63) is
specified, the system manager (PID 1) will activate the specified virtual terminal when it crashes.
Defaults to disabled, meaning that no such switch is attempted. If set to enabled, the virtual
terminal the kernel messages are written to is used instead.

.. only:: html

   .. versionadded:: 233

``systemd.crash_shell``
-----------------------

Takes a boolean argument or enables the option if specified
without an argument. If enabled, the system manager (PID 1) spawns a shell
when it crashes, after a 10s delay. Otherwise, no shell is spawned. Defaults
to disabled, for security reasons, as the shell is not protected by password
authentication.

.. only:: html

   .. versionadded:: 233

``systemd.crash_action=``
-------------------------

Takes one of "freeze", "reboot" or
"poweroff". Defaults to "freeze". If set to
"freeze", the system will hang indefinitely when the system manager (PID 1) crashes.
If set to "reboot", the system manager (PID 1) will reboot the machine automatically
when it crashes, after a 10s delay. If set to "poweroff", the system manager (PID 1)
will power off the machine immediately when it crashes. If combined with
:directive:kernel-commandline-options:var:`systemd.crash_shell`, the configured crash action is executed after the shell
exits.

.. only:: html

   .. versionadded:: 256

``systemd.confirm_spawn``
-------------------------

Takes a boolean argument or a path to the virtual console
where the confirmation messages should be emitted. Can be also specified
without an argument, with the same effect as a positive boolean. If enabled,
the system manager (PID 1) asks for confirmation when spawning processes
using :directive:kernel-commandline-options:option:`/dev/console`. If a path or a console name (such as
"ttyS0") is provided, the virtual console pointed to by this
path or described by the give name will be used instead. Defaults to disabled.

.. only:: html

   .. versionadded:: 233

``systemd.service_watchdogs=``
------------------------------

Takes a boolean argument. If disabled, all service runtime
watchdogs (:directive:kernel-commandline-options:option:`WatchdogSec=`) and emergency actions (e.g.
:directive:kernel-commandline-options:option:`OnFailure=` or :directive:kernel-commandline-options:option:`StartLimitAction=`) are
ignored by the system manager (PID 1); see
:ref:`systemd.service(5)`.
Defaults to enabled, i.e. watchdogs and failure actions are processed
normally. The hardware watchdog is not affected by this
option.

.. only:: html

   .. versionadded:: 237

``systemd.show_status``
-----------------------

Takes a boolean argument or the constants :directive:kernel-commandline-options:constant:`error` and
:directive:kernel-commandline-options:constant:`auto`. Can be also specified without an argument, with the same effect as a
positive boolean. If enabled, the systemd manager (PID 1) shows terse service status updates on the
console during bootup. With :directive:kernel-commandline-options:constant:`error`, only messages about failures are shown, but
boot is otherwise quiet. :directive:kernel-commandline-options:constant:`auto` behaves like :directive:kernel-commandline-options:option:`false` until there is
a significant delay in boot. Defaults to enabled, unless :directive:kernel-commandline-options:option:`quiet` is passed as kernel
command line option, in which case it defaults to :directive:kernel-commandline-options:constant:`error`. If specified overrides
the system manager configuration file option :directive:kernel-commandline-options:option:`ShowStatus=`, see
:ref:`systemd-system.conf(5)`.

.. only:: html

   .. versionadded:: 233

``systemd.status_unit_format=``
-------------------------------

Takes :directive:kernel-commandline-options:option:`name`, :directive:kernel-commandline-options:option:`description` or
:directive:kernel-commandline-options:option:`combined` as the value. If :directive:kernel-commandline-options:option:`name`, the system manager will use unit
names in status messages. If :directive:kernel-commandline-options:option:`combined`, the system manager will use unit names and
description in status messages. When specified, overrides the system manager configuration file
option :directive:kernel-commandline-options:option:`StatusUnitFormat=`, see
:ref:`systemd-system.conf(5)`.

:directive:kernel-commandline-options:var:`systemd.log_color`, :directive:kernel-commandline-options:var:`systemd.log_location`,
:directive:kernel-commandline-options:var:`systemd.log_time`, :directive:kernel-commandline-options:var:`systemd.log_tid` and
:directive:kernel-commandline-options:var:`systemd.log_ratelimit_kmsg` can be specified without
an argument, with the same effect as a positive boolean.

``systemd.default_standard_output=, systemd.default_standard_error=``
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Controls default standard output and error output for services and sockets. That is,
controls the default for :directive:kernel-commandline-options:option:`StandardOutput=` and :directive:kernel-commandline-options:option:`StandardError=` (see
:ref:`systemd.exec(5)` for
details). Takes one of :directive:kernel-commandline-options:option:`inherit`, :directive:kernel-commandline-options:option:`null`, :directive:kernel-commandline-options:option:`tty`,
:directive:kernel-commandline-options:option:`journal`, :directive:kernel-commandline-options:option:`journal+console`, :directive:kernel-commandline-options:option:`kmsg`,
:directive:kernel-commandline-options:option:`kmsg+console`. If the argument is omitted
:directive:kernel-commandline-options:var:`systemd.default-standard-output=` defaults to :directive:kernel-commandline-options:option:`journal` and
:directive:kernel-commandline-options:var:`systemd.default-standard-error=` to :directive:kernel-commandline-options:option:`inherit`.

``systemd.setenv=``
-------------------

Takes a string argument in the form
VARIABLE=VALUE. May be used to set default environment
variables to add to forked child processes. May be used more
than once to set multiple variables.

``systemd.machine_id=``
-----------------------

Takes a 32 character hex value to be
used for setting the machine-id. Intended mostly for
network booting where the same machine-id is desired
for every boot.

.. only:: html

   .. versionadded:: 229

``systemd.set_credential=, systemd.set_credential_binary=``
-----------------------------------------------------------

Sets a system credential, which can then be propagated to system services using the
:directive:kernel-commandline-options:var:`ImportCredential=` or :directive:kernel-commandline-options:var:`LoadCredential=` setting, see
:ref:`systemd.exec(5)` for
details. Takes a pair of credential name and value, separated by a colon. The
:directive:kernel-commandline-options:var:`systemd.set_credential=` parameter expects the credential value in literal text
form, the :directive:kernel-commandline-options:var:`systemd.set_credential_binary=` parameter takes binary data encoded in
Base64. Note that the kernel command line is typically accessible by unprivileged programs in
``/proc/cmdline``. Thus, this mechanism is not suitable for transferring sensitive
data. Use it only for data that is not sensitive (e.g. public keys/certificates, rather than private
keys), or in testing/debugging environments.

``quiet``
---------

Turn off status output at boot, much like
:directive:kernel-commandline-options:var:`systemd.show_status=no` would. Note that
this option is also read by the kernel itself and disables
kernel log output. Passing this option hence turns off the
usual output from both the system manager and the kernel.

``debug``
---------

Turn on debugging output. This is equivalent
to :directive:kernel-commandline-options:var:`systemd.log_level=debug`. Note that this

System Credentials
==================

During initialization the service manager will import credentials from various sources into the
system's set of credentials, which can then be propagated into services and consumed by
generators:

* When the service manager first initializes it will read system credentials from SMBIOS
  Type 11 vendor strings
  ``io.systemd.credential:<name>=<value>``,
  and
  ``io.systemd.credential.binary:<name>=<value>``.
  At the same time it will import credentials from QEMU "fw_cfg". (Note
  that the SMBIOS mechanism is generally preferred, because it is faster and generic.)
  Credentials may be passed via the kernel command line, using the
  ``systemd.set-credential=`` parameter, see above.
  Credentials may be passed from the UEFI environment via
  :ref:`systemd-stub(7)`.
  When the service manager is invoked during the initrd → host transition it will import
  all files in ``/run/credentials/@initrd/`` as system credentials.

Invoke
:ref:`systemd-creds(1)` as
follows to see the list of credentials passed into the system:

.. code-block:: sh

   # systemd-creds --system list

For further information see `System and Service
Credentials <https://systemd.io/CREDENTIALS>`_ documentation.

The service manager when run as PID 1 consumes the following system credentials:

``vmm.notify_socket``
---------------------

Contains a :directive:system-credentials:constant:`AF_VSOCK` or :directive:system-credentials:constant:`AF_UNIX` address where to
send a :directive:system-credentials:constant:`READY=1` notification message when the service manager has completed
booting. See
:ref:`sd_notify(3)` and
the next section for more information. Note that in case the hypervisor does not support
:directive:system-credentials:constant:`SOCK_DGRAM` over :directive:system-credentials:constant:`AF_VSOCK`,
:directive:system-credentials:constant:`SOCK_SEQPACKET` will be tried instead. The credential payload for
:directive:system-credentials:constant:`AF_VSOCK` should be a string in the form
"vsock:CID:PORT". "vsock-stream", "vsock-dgram"
and "vsock-seqpacket" can be used instead of "vsock" to force
usage of the corresponding socket type.

This feature is useful for machine managers or other processes on the host to receive a
notification via VSOCK when a virtual machine has finished booting.

.. only:: html

   .. versionadded:: 254

``system.machine_id``
---------------------

Takes a 128bit hexadecimal ID to initialize ``/etc/machine-id`` from, if the
file is not set up yet. See
:ref:`machine-id(5)` for
details.

.. only:: html

   .. versionadded:: 254

For a list of system credentials various other components of systemd consume, see
:ref:`systemd.system-credentials(7)`.

Readiness Protocol
==================

The service manager implements a readiness notification protocol both between the manager and its
services (i.e. down the stack), and between the manager and a potential supervisor further up the stack
(the latter could be a machine or container manager, or in case of a per-user service manager the system
service manager instance). The basic protocol (and the suggested API for it) is described in
:ref:`sd_notify(3)`.

The notification socket the service manager (including PID 1) uses for reporting readiness to its
own supervisor is set via the usual ``$NOTIFY_SOCKET`` environment variable (see
above). Since this is directly settable only for container managers and for the per-user instance of the
service manager, an additional mechanism to configure this is available, in particular intended for use
in VM environments: the ``vmm.notify_socket`` system credential (see above) may be set to
a suitable socket (typically an ``AF_VSOCK`` one) via SMBIOS Type 11 vendor strings. For
details see above.

The notification protocol from the service manager up the stack towards a supervisor supports a
number of extension fields that allow a supervisor to learn about specific properties of the system and
track its boot progress. Specifically the following fields are sent:

* An ``X_SYSTEMD_HOSTNAME=…`` message will be sent out once the initial
  hostname for the system has been determined. Note that during later runtime the hostname might be
  changed again programmatically, and (currently) no further notifications are sent out in that case.

  .. only:: html

     .. versionadded:: 256
  An ``X_SYSTEMD_MACHINE_ID=…`` message will be sent out once the machine
  ID of the system has been determined. See
  :ref:`machine-id(5)` for
  details.

  .. only:: html

     .. versionadded:: 256
  An ``X_SYSTEMD_SIGNALS_LEVEL=…`` message will be sent out once the
  service manager installed the various UNIX process signal handlers described above. The field's value
  is an unsigned integer formatted as decimal string, and indicates the supported UNIX process signal
  feature level of the service manager. Currently, only a single feature level is defined:

  * ``X_SYSTEMD_SIGNALS_LEVEL=2`` covers the various UNIX process signals
    documented above – which are a superset of those supported by the historical SysV init
    system.
  Signals sent to PID 1 before this message is sent might not be handled correctly yet. A consumer
  of these messages should parse the value as an unsigned integer indication the level of support. For
  now only the mentioned level 2 is defined, but later on additional levels might be defined with higher
  integers, that will implement a superset of the currently defined behaviour.

  .. only:: html

     .. versionadded:: 256
  ``X_SYSTEMD_UNIT_ACTIVE=…`` and
  ``X_SYSTEMD_UNIT_INACTIVE=…`` messages will be sent out for each target unit as it
  becomes active or stops being active. This is useful to track boot progress and functionality. For
  example, once the ``ssh-access.target`` unit is reported started SSH access is
  typically available, see
  :ref:`systemd.special(7)` for
  details.

  .. only:: html

     .. versionadded:: 256
  An ``X_SYSTEMD_SHUTDOWN=…`` message will be sent out very shortly before
  the system shuts down. The value is one of the strings "reboot",
  "halt", "poweroff", "kexec" and indicates which kind
  of shutdown is being executed.

  .. only:: html

     .. versionadded:: 256
  An ``X_SYSTEMD_REBOOT_PARAMETER=…`` message will also be sent out very
  shortly before the system shuts down. Its value is the reboot argument as configured with
  ``systemctl --reboot-argument=…``.

     .. versionadded:: 256

Note that these extension fields are sent in addition to the regular "READY=1" and
"RELOADING=1" notifications.

Options
=======

``systemd`` is only very rarely invoked directly, since it is started early and is
already running by the time users may interact with it. Normally, tools like
:ref:`systemctl(1)` are used to
give commands to the manager. Since ``systemd`` is usually not invoked directly, the
options listed below are mostly useful for debugging and special purposes.

Introspection and debugging options
-----------------------------------

Those options are used for testing and introspection, and ``systemd`` may
be invoked with them at any time:

.. option:: --dump-configuration-items

   Dump understood unit configuration items. This outputs a terse but complete list of
   configuration items understood in unit definition files.

.. option:: --dump-bus-properties

   Dump exposed bus properties. This outputs a terse but complete list of properties
   exposed on D-Bus.

   .. only:: html

      .. versionadded:: 239

.. option:: --test

   Determine the initial start-up transaction (i.e. the list of jobs enqueued at
   start-up), dump it and exit — without actually executing any of the determined jobs. This option is
   useful for debugging only. Note that during regular service manager start-up additional units not
   shown by this operation may be started, because hardware, socket, bus or other kinds of activation
   might add additional jobs as the transaction is executed. Use ``--system`` to request
   the initial transaction of the system service manager (this is also the implied default), combine
   with ``--user`` to request the initial transaction of the per-user service manager
   instead.

.. option:: --system, --user

   When used in conjunction with ``--test``, selects whether to calculate
   the initial transaction for the system instance or for a per-user instance. These options have no
   effect when invoked without ``--test``, as during regular
   (i.e. non-``--test``) invocations the service manager will automatically detect
   whether it shall operate in system or per-user mode, by checking whether the PID it is run as is 1
   or not. Note that it is not supported booting and maintaining a system with the service manager
   running in ``--system`` mode but with a PID other than 1.

Options that duplicate kernel command line settings
---------------------------------------------------

Those options correspond directly to options listed above in "Kernel Command Line". Both forms
may be used equivalently for the system manager, but it is recommended to use the forms listed above in
this context, because they are properly namespaced. When an option is specified both on the kernel
command line and as a normal command line argument, the latter has higher precedence.

When ``systemd`` is used as a user manager, the kernel command line is ignored and
only the options described below are understood. Nevertheless, ``systemd`` is usually
started in this mode through the
:ref:`user@.service(5)`
service, which is shared between all users. It may be more convenient to use configuration files to
modify settings (see
:ref:`systemd-user.conf(5)`),
or environment variables. See the "Environment" section above for a discussion of how the environment
block is set.

.. option:: --unit=

   Set default unit to activate on startup. If not specified, defaults to
   ``default.target``. See ``systemd.unit=`` above.

.. option:: --dump-core

   Enable core dumping on crash. This switch has no effect when running as user
   instance. Same as ``systemd.dump_core=`` above.

.. option:: --crash-vt=<VT>

   Switch to a specific virtual console (VT) on crash. This switch has no effect when
   running as user instance. Same as ``systemd.crash_chvt=`` above (but not the
   different spelling!).

      .. versionadded:: 227

.. option:: --crash-shell

   Run a shell on crash. This switch has no effect when running as user instance. See
   ``systemd.crash_shell=`` above.

.. option:: --crash-action=

   Specify what to do when the system manager (PID 1) crashes. This switch has no
   effect when systemd is running as user instance. See ``systemd.crash_action=``
   above.

   Sets the default output or error output for all services and sockets,
   respectively. See ``systemd.default_standard_output=`` and
   ``systemd.default_standard_error=`` above.

System clock epoch
==================

When ``systemd`` is started or restarted, it may set the system clock to the
"epoch". This mechanism is used to ensure that the system clock remains somewhat reasonably initialized
and roughly monotonic across reboots, in case no battery-backed local RTC is available or it does not
work correctly.

The epoch is the lowest date above which the system clock time is assumed to be set correctly. When
initializing, the local clock is *advanced* to the epoch if it was set to a lower
value. As a special case, if the local clock is sufficiently far in the future (by default 15 years, but
this can be configured at build time), the hardware clock is assumed to be broken, and the system clock
is *rewound* to the epoch.

The epoch is set to the highest of: the build time of ``systemd``, the
modification time ("mtime") of ``/usr/lib/clock-epoch``, and the modification time of
``/var/lib/systemd/timesync/clock``.
