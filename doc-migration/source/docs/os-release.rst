   Synopsis

``/etc/os-release``
``/usr/lib/os-release``
``/etc/initrd-release``
``/usr/lib/extension-release.d/extension-release.<IMAGE>``

Description
===========

The ``/etc/os-release`` and
``/usr/lib/os-release`` files contain operating
system identification data.

The format of ``os-release`` is a newline-separated list of
environment-like shell-compatible variable assignments. It is possible to source the configuration from
Bourne shell scripts, however, beyond mere variable assignments, no shell features are supported (this
means variable expansion is explicitly not supported), allowing applications to read the file without
implementing a shell compatible execution engine. Variable assignment values must be enclosed in double
or single quotes if they include spaces, semicolons or other special characters outside of A–Z, a–z,
0–9. (Assignments that do not include these special characters may be enclosed in quotes too, but this is
optional.) Shell special characters ("$", quotes, backslash, backtick) must be escaped with backslashes,
following shell style. All strings should be in UTF-8 encoding, and non-printable characters should not
be used. Concatenation of multiple individually quoted strings is not supported. Lines beginning with "#"
are treated as comments. Blank lines are permitted and ignored.

The file ``/etc/os-release`` takes
precedence over ``/usr/lib/os-release``.
Applications should check for the former, and exclusively use its
data if it exists, and only fall back to
``/usr/lib/os-release`` if it is missing.
Applications should not read data from both files at the same
time. ``/usr/lib/os-release`` is the recommended
place to store OS release information as part of vendor trees.
``/etc/os-release`` should be a relative symlink
to ``/usr/lib/os-release``, to provide
compatibility with applications only looking at
``/etc/``. A relative symlink instead of an
absolute symlink is necessary to avoid breaking the link in a
chroot or initrd environment.

``os-release`` contains data that is
defined by the operating system vendor and should generally not be
changed by the administrator.

As this file only encodes names and identifiers it should
not be localized.

The ``/etc/os-release`` and
``/usr/lib/os-release`` files might be symlinks
to other files, but it is important that the file is available
from earliest boot on, and hence must be located on the root file
system.

``os-release`` must not contain repeating keys. Nevertheless, readers should pick
the entries later in the file in case of repeats, similarly to how a shell sourcing the file would. A
reader may warn about repeating entries.

For a longer rationale for ``os-release``
please refer to the `Announcement of ``/etc/os-release`` <https://0pointer.de/blog/projects/os-release>`_.

``/etc/initrd-release``
-----------------------

In the `initrd <https://docs.kernel.org/admin-guide/initrd.html>`_,
``/etc/initrd-release`` plays the same role as ``os-release`` in the
main system. Additionally, the presence of that file means that the system is in the initrd phase.
``/etc/os-release`` should be symlinked to ``/etc/initrd-release``
(or vice versa), so programs that only look for ``/etc/os-release`` (as described
above) work correctly.

The rest of this document that talks about ``os-release`` should be understood
to apply to ``initrd-release`` too.

``/usr/lib/extension-release.d/extension-release.<IMAGE>``
----------------------------------------------------------

``/usr/lib/extension-release.d/extension-release.<IMAGE>``
plays the same role for extension images as ``os-release`` for the main system, and
follows the syntax and rules as described in the `Portable Services <https://systemd.io/PORTABLE_SERVICES>`_ page. The purpose of this
file is to identify the extension and to allow the operating system to verify that the extension image
matches the base OS. This is typically implemented by checking that the ``ID=`` options
match, and either ``SYSEXT_LEVEL=`` exists and matches too, or if it is not present,
``VERSION_ID=`` exists and matches. This ensures ABI/API compatibility between the
layers and prevents merging of an incompatible image in an overlay.

In order to identify the extension image itself, the same fields defined below can be added to the
``extension-release`` file with a ``SYSEXT_`` prefix (to disambiguate
from fields used to match on the base image). E.g.: ``SYSEXT_ID=myext``,
``SYSEXT_VERSION_ID=1.2.3``.

In the ``extension-release.<IMAGE>`` filename, the
<IMAGE> part must exactly match the file name of the containing image with the
suffix removed. In case it is not possible to guarantee that an image file name is stable and doesn't
change between the build and the deployment phases, it is possible to relax this check: if exactly one
file whose name matches "``extension-release.*``" is present in this
directory, and the file is tagged with a ``user.extension-release.strict``
:man-pages:`xattr(7)` set to the
string "0", it will be used instead.

The rest of this document that talks about ``os-release`` should be understood
to apply to ``extension-release`` too.

Options
=======

The following OS identifications parameters may be set using
``os-release``:

General information identifying the operating system
----------------------------------------------------

.. option:: NAME=

   A string identifying the operating system, without a version component, and
   suitable for presentation to the user. If not set, a default of "NAME=Linux" may
   be used.

   Examples: "NAME=Fedora", "NAME="Debian GNU/Linux"".

.. option:: ID=

   A lower-case string (no spaces or other characters outside of 0–9, a–z, ".", "_"
   and "-") identifying the operating system, excluding any version information and suitable for
   processing by scripts or usage in generated filenames. If not set, a default of
   "ID=linux" may be used. Note that even though this string may not include
   characters that require shell quoting, quoting may nevertheless be used.

   Examples: "ID=fedora", "ID=debian".

.. option:: ID_LIKE=

   A space-separated list of operating system identifiers in the same syntax as the
   :directive:environment-variables:var:`ID=` setting. It should list identifiers of operating systems that are closely
   related to the local operating system in regards to packaging and programming interfaces, for
   example listing one or more OS identifiers the local OS is a derivative from.  An OS should
   generally only list other OS identifiers it itself is a derivative of, and not any OSes that are
   derived from it, though symmetric relationships are possible. Build scripts and similar should
   check this variable if they need to identify the local operating system and the value of
   :directive:environment-variables:var:`ID=` is not recognized. Operating systems should be listed in order of how
   closely the local operating system relates to the listed ones, starting with the closest. This
   field is optional.

   Examples: for an operating system with "ID=centos", an assignment of
   "ID_LIKE="rhel fedora"" would be appropriate. For an operating system with
   "ID=ubuntu", an assignment of "ID_LIKE=debian" is appropriate.

.. option:: PRETTY_NAME=

   A pretty operating system name in a format suitable for presentation to the
   user. May or may not contain a release code name or OS version of some kind, as suitable. If not
   set, a default of "PRETTY_NAME="Linux"" may be used

   Example: "PRETTY_NAME="Fedora 17 (Beefy Miracle)"".

.. option:: CPE_NAME=

   A CPE name for the operating system, in URI binding syntax, following the `Common Platform Enumeration Specification <http://scap.nist.gov/specifications/cpe/>`_ as
   proposed by the NIST. This field is optional.

   Example: "CPE_NAME="cpe:/o:fedoraproject:fedora:17""

.. option:: VARIANT=

   A string identifying a specific variant or edition of the operating system suitable
   for presentation to the user. This field may be used to inform the user that the configuration of
   this system is subject to a specific divergent set of rules or default configuration settings. This
   field is optional and may not be implemented on all systems.

   Examples: "VARIANT="Server Edition"", "VARIANT="Smart Refrigerator
   Edition"".

   Note: this field is for display purposes only. The :directive:environment-variables:var:`VARIANT_ID` field should
   be used for making programmatic decisions.

   .. only:: html

      .. versionadded:: 220

.. option:: VARIANT_ID=

   A lower-case string (no spaces or other characters outside of 0–9, a–z, ".", "_" and
   "-"), identifying a specific variant or edition of the operating system. This may be interpreted by
   other packages in order to determine a divergent default configuration. This field is optional and
   may not be implemented on all systems.

   Examples: "VARIANT_ID=server", "VARIANT_ID=embedded".

   .. only:: html

      .. versionadded:: 220

Information about the version of the operating system
-----------------------------------------------------

.. option:: VERSION=

   A string identifying the operating system version, excluding any OS name
   information, possibly including a release code name, and suitable for presentation to the
   user. This field is optional.

   Examples: "VERSION=17", "VERSION="17 (Beefy Miracle)"".

.. option:: VERSION_ID=

   A lower-case string (mostly numeric, no spaces or other characters outside of 0–9,
   a–z, ".", "_" and "-") identifying the operating system version, excluding any OS name information
   or release code name, and suitable for processing by scripts or usage in generated filenames. This
   field is optional.

   Examples: "VERSION_ID=17", "VERSION_ID=11.04".

.. option:: VERSION_CODENAME=

   A lower-case string (no spaces or other characters outside of 0–9, a–z, ".", "_"
   and "-") identifying the operating system release code name, excluding any OS name information or
   release version, and suitable for processing by scripts or usage in generated filenames. This field
   is optional and may not be implemented on all systems.

   Examples: "VERSION_CODENAME=buster",
   "VERSION_CODENAME=xenial".

   .. only:: html

      .. versionadded:: 231

.. option:: BUILD_ID=

   A string uniquely identifying the system image originally used as the installation
   base. In most cases, :directive:environment-variables:var:`VERSION_ID` or
   :directive:environment-variables:var:`IMAGE_ID`+:directive:environment-variables:var:`IMAGE_VERSION` are updated when the entire system
   image is replaced during an update. :directive:environment-variables:var:`BUILD_ID` may be used in distributions where
   the original installation image version is important: :directive:environment-variables:var:`VERSION_ID` would change
   during incremental system updates, but :directive:environment-variables:var:`BUILD_ID` would not. This field is
   optional.

   Examples: "BUILD_ID="2013-03-20.3"", "BUILD_ID=201303203".

   .. only:: html

      .. versionadded:: 200

.. option:: IMAGE_ID=

   A lower-case string (no spaces or other characters outside of 0–9, a–z, ".", "_"
   and "-"), identifying a specific image of the operating system. This is supposed to be used for
   environments where OS images are prepared, built, shipped and updated as comprehensive, consistent
   OS images. This field is optional and may not be implemented on all systems, in particularly not on
   those that are not managed via images but put together and updated from individual packages and on
   the local system.

   Examples: "IMAGE_ID=vendorx-cashier-system",
   "IMAGE_ID=netbook-image".

   .. only:: html

      .. versionadded:: 249

.. option:: IMAGE_VERSION=

   A lower-case string (mostly numeric, no spaces or other characters outside of 0–9,
   a–z, ".", "_" and "-") identifying the OS image version. This is supposed to be used together with
   :directive:environment-variables:var:`IMAGE_ID` described above, to discern different versions of the same image.

   Examples: "IMAGE_VERSION=33", "IMAGE_VERSION=47.1rc1".

   .. only:: html

      .. versionadded:: 249

To summarize: if the image updates are built and shipped as comprehensive units,
``IMAGE_ID``+``IMAGE_VERSION`` is the best fit. Otherwise, if updates
eventually completely replace previously installed contents, as in a typical binary distribution,
``VERSION_ID`` should be used to identify major releases of the operating system.
``BUILD_ID`` may be used instead or in addition to ``VERSION_ID`` when
the original system image version is important.

Presentation information and links
----------------------------------

.. option:: HOME_URL=, DOCUMENTATION_URL=, SUPPORT_URL=, BUG_REPORT_URL=, PRIVACY_POLICY_URL=

   Links to resources on the Internet related to the operating system.
   :directive:environment-variables:var:`HOME_URL=` should refer to the homepage of the operating system, or alternatively
   some homepage of the specific version of the operating system.
   :directive:environment-variables:var:`DOCUMENTATION_URL=` should refer to the main documentation page for this
   operating system.  :directive:environment-variables:var:`SUPPORT_URL=` should refer to the main support page for the
   operating system, if there is any. This is primarily intended for operating systems which vendors
   provide support for. :directive:environment-variables:var:`BUG_REPORT_URL=` should refer to the main bug reporting page
   for the operating system, if there is any. This is primarily intended for operating systems that
   rely on community QA. :directive:environment-variables:var:`PRIVACY_POLICY_URL=` should refer to the main privacy
   policy page for the operating system, if there is any. These settings are optional, and providing
   only some of these settings is common. These URLs are intended to be exposed in "About this system"
   UIs behind links with captions such as "About this Operating System", "Obtain Support", "Report a
   Bug", or "Privacy Policy". The values should be in `RFC3986 format <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986>`_, and should be
   "http:" or "https:" URLs, and possibly "mailto:"
   or "tel:". Only one URL shall be listed in each setting. If multiple resources
   need to be referenced, it is recommended to provide an online landing page linking all available
   resources.

   Examples: "HOME_URL="https://fedoraproject.org/"",
   "BUG_REPORT_URL="https://bugzilla.redhat.com/"".

.. option:: SUPPORT_END=

   The date at which support for this version of the OS ends. (What exactly "lack of
   support" means varies between vendors, but generally users should assume that updates, including
   security fixes, will not be provided.) The value is a date in the ISO 8601 format
   "YYYY-MM-DD", and specifies the first day on which support *is
   not* provided.

   For example, "SUPPORT_END=2001-01-01" means that the system was supported
   until the end of the last day of the previous millennium.

   .. only:: html

      .. versionadded:: 252

.. option:: LOGO=

   A string, specifying the name of an icon as defined by `freedesktop.org Icon Theme
   Specification <https://standards.freedesktop.org/icon-theme-spec/latest>`_. This can be used by graphical applications to display an operating system's
   or distributor's logo. This field is optional and may not necessarily be implemented on all
   systems.

   Examples: "LOGO=fedora-logo", "LOGO=distributor-logo-opensuse"

   .. only:: html

      .. versionadded:: 240

.. option:: ANSI_COLOR=

   A suggested presentation color when showing the OS name on the console. This should
   be specified as string suitable for inclusion in the ESC [ m ANSI/ECMA-48 escape code for setting
   graphical rendition. This field is optional.

   Examples: "ANSI_COLOR="0;31"" for red, "ANSI_COLOR="1;34""
   for light blue, or "ANSI_COLOR="0;38;2;60;110;180"" for Fedora blue.

.. option:: VENDOR_NAME=

   The name of the OS vendor. This is the name of the organization or company which
   produces the OS. This field is optional.

   This name is intended to be exposed in "About this system" UIs or software update UIs when
   needed to distinguish the OS vendor from the OS itself. It is intended to be human readable.

   Examples: "VENDOR_NAME="Fedora Project"" for Fedora Linux,
   "VENDOR_NAME="Canonical"" for Ubuntu.

   .. only:: html

      .. versionadded:: 254

.. option:: VENDOR_URL=

   The homepage of the OS vendor. This field is optional. The
   :directive:environment-variables:var:`VENDOR_NAME=` field should be set if this one is, although clients must be
   robust against either field not being set.

   The value should be in `RFC3986 format <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986>`_, and should be
   "http:" or "https:" URLs. Only one URL shall be listed in the
   setting.

   Examples: "VENDOR_URL="https://fedoraproject.org/"",
   "VENDOR_URL="https://canonical.com/"".

   .. only:: html

      .. versionadded:: 254

Distribution-level defaults and metadata
----------------------------------------

.. option:: DEFAULT_HOSTNAME=

   A string specifying the hostname if
   :ref:`hostname(5)` is not
   present and no other configuration source specifies the hostname. Must be either a single DNS label
   (a string composed of 7-bit ASCII lower-case characters and no spaces or dots, limited to the
   format allowed for DNS domain name labels), or a sequence of such labels separated by single dots
   that forms a valid DNS FQDN. The hostname must be at most 64 characters, which is a Linux
   limitation (DNS allows longer names).

   See :ref:`org.freedesktop.hostname1(5)`
   for a description of how
   :ref:`systemd-hostnamed.service(8)`
   determines the fallback hostname.

   .. only:: html

      .. versionadded:: 248

.. option:: ARCHITECTURE=

   A string that specifies which CPU architecture the userspace binaries require.
   The architecture identifiers are the same as for :directive:environment-variables:var:`ConditionArchitecture=`
   described in :ref:`systemd.unit(5)`.
   The field is optional and should only be used when just single architecture is supported.
   It may provide redundant information when used in a GPT partition with a GUID type that already
   encodes the architecture. If this is not the case, the architecture should be specified in
   e.g., an extension image, to prevent an incompatible host from loading it.

   .. only:: html

      .. versionadded:: 252

.. option:: SYSEXT_LEVEL=

   A lower-case string (mostly numeric, no spaces or other characters outside of 0–9,
   a–z, ".", "_" and "-") identifying the operating system extensions support level, to indicate which
   extension images are supported. See ``/usr/lib/extension-release.d/extension-release.<IMAGE>``,
   `initrd <https://docs.kernel.org/admin-guide/initrd.html>`_ and
   :ref:`systemd-sysext(8)`)
   for more information.

   Examples: "SYSEXT_LEVEL=2", "SYSEXT_LEVEL=15.14".

   .. only:: html

      .. versionadded:: 248

.. option:: CONFEXT_LEVEL=

   Semantically the same as :directive:environment-variables:var:`SYSEXT_LEVEL=` but for confext images.
   See ``/etc/extension-release.d/extension-release.<IMAGE>``
   for more information.

   Examples: "CONFEXT_LEVEL=2", "CONFEXT_LEVEL=15.14".

   .. only:: html

      .. versionadded:: 254

.. option:: SYSEXT_SCOPE=

   Takes a space-separated list of one or more of the strings
   "system", "initrd" and "portable". This field is
   only supported in ``extension-release.d/`` files and indicates what environments
   the system extension is applicable to: i.e. to regular systems, to initrds, or to portable service
   images. If unspecified, "SYSEXT_SCOPE=system portable" is implied, i.e. any system
   extension without this field is applicable to regular systems and to portable service environments,
   but not to initrd environments.

   .. only:: html

      .. versionadded:: 250

.. option:: CONFEXT_SCOPE=

   Semantically the same as :directive:environment-variables:var:`SYSEXT_SCOPE=` but for confext images.

   .. only:: html

      .. versionadded:: 254

.. option:: PORTABLE_PREFIXES=

   Takes a space-separated list of one or more valid prefix match strings for the
   `Portable Services <https://systemd.io/PORTABLE_SERVICES>`_ logic.
   This field serves two purposes: it is informational, identifying portable service images as such
   (and thus allowing them to be distinguished from other OS images, such as bootable system images).
   It is also used when a portable service image is attached: the specified or implied portable
   service prefix is checked against the list specified here, to enforce restrictions how images may
   be attached to a system.

   .. only:: html

      .. versionadded:: 250

Notes
-----

If you are using this file to determine the OS or a specific version of it, use the
``ID`` and ``VERSION_ID`` fields, possibly with
``ID_LIKE`` as fallback for ``ID``. When looking for an OS identification
string for presentation to the user use the ``PRETTY_NAME`` field.

Note that operating system vendors may choose not to provide version information, for example to
accommodate for rolling releases. In this case, ``VERSION`` and
``VERSION_ID`` may be unset. Applications should not rely on these fields to be
set.

Operating system vendors may extend the file format and introduce new fields. It is highly
recommended to prefix new fields with an OS specific name in order to avoid name clashes. Applications
reading this file must ignore unknown fields.

Example: "DEBIAN_BTS="debbugs://bugs.debian.org/"".

Container and sandbox runtime managers may make the host's identification data available to
applications by providing the host's ``/etc/os-release`` (if available, otherwise
``/usr/lib/os-release`` as a fallback) as
``/run/host/os-release``.
