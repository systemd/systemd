# Using DNS= configures global DNS servers and does not suppress link-specific
# configuration. Parallel requests will be sent to per-link DNS servers
# configured automatically by systemd-networkd.service(8), NetworkManager(8), or
# similar management services, or configured manually via resolvectl(1). See
# resolved.conf(5) and systemd-resolved(8) for more details.
