/* Brightness and LED devices tend to be very slow to write to (often being I2C and such). Writes to the
 * sysfs attributes are synchronous, and hence will freeze our process on access. We can't really have that,
 * hence we add some complexity: whenever we need to write to the brightness attribute, we do so in a forked
 * off process, which terminates when it is done. Watching that process allows us to watch completion of the
 * write operation.
 *
 * To make this even more complex: clients are likely to send us many write requests in a short time-frame
 * (because they implement reactive brightness sliders on screen). Let's coalesce writes to make this
 * efficient: whenever we get requests to change brightness while we are still writing to the brightness
 * attribute, let's remember the request and restart a new one when the initial operation finished. When we
 * get another request while one is ongoing and one is pending we'll replace the pending one with the new
 * one.
 *
 * The bus messages are answered when the first write operation finishes that started either due to the
 * request or due to a later request that overrode the requested one.
 *
 * Yes, this is complex, but I don't see an easier way if we want to be both efficient and still support
 * completion notification. */
