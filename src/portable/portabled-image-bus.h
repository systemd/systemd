/* So here's some complexity: some of operations can either take an image name, or a fully qualified file system path
 * to an image. We need to authenticate differently when processing these two: images referenced via simple image names
 * mean the images are located in the image search path and thus safe for limited read access for unprivileged
 * clients. For operations on images located anywhere else we need explicit authentication however, so that
 * unprivileged clients can't make us open arbitrary files in the file system.
 *
 * The "Image" bus objects directly represent images in the image search path, but do not exist for path-referenced
 * images. Hence, when requesting a bus object we need to refuse references by file system path, but still allow
 * references by image name. Depending on the operation to execute potentially we need to authenticate in all cases. */
