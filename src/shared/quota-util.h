/* Wrapper around the QCMD() macro of linux/quota.h that removes some undefined behaviour. A typical quota
 * command such as QCMD(Q_GETQUOTA, USRQUOTA) cannot be resolved on platforms where "int" is 32-bit, as it is
 * larger than INT_MAX. Yikes, because that are basically all platforms Linux supports. Let's add a wrapper
 * that explicitly takes its arguments as unsigned 32-bit, and then converts the shift result explicitly to
 * int, acknowledging the undefined behaviour of the kernel headers. This doesn't remove the undefined
 * behaviour, but it stops ubsan from complaining about it. */
