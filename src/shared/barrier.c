/**
 * Barriers
 * This barrier implementation provides a simple synchronization method based
 * on file-descriptors that can safely be used between threads and processes. A
 * barrier object contains 2 shared counters based on eventfd. Both processes
 * can now place barriers and wait for the other end to reach a random or
 * specific barrier.
 * Barriers are numbered, so you can either wait for the other end to reach any
 * barrier or the last barrier that you placed. This way, you can use barriers
 * for one-way *and* full synchronization. Note that even-though barriers are
 * numbered, these numbers are internal and recycled once both sides reached the
 * same barrier (implemented as a simple signed counter). It is thus not
 * possible to address barriers by their ID.
 *
 * Barrier-API: Both ends can place as many barriers via barrier_place() as
 * they want and each pair of barriers on both sides will be implicitly linked.
 * Each side can use the barrier_wait/sync_*() family of calls to wait for the
 * other side to place a specific barrier. barrier_wait_next() waits until the
 * other side calls barrier_place(). No links between the barriers are
 * considered and this simply serves as most basic asynchronous barrier.
 * barrier_sync_next() is like barrier_wait_next() and waits for the other side
 * to place their next barrier via barrier_place(). However, it only waits for
 * barriers that are linked to a barrier we already placed. If the other side
 * already placed more barriers than we did, barrier_sync_next() returns
 * immediately.
 * barrier_sync() extends barrier_sync_next() and waits until the other end
 * placed as many barriers via barrier_place() as we did. If they already placed
 * as many as we did (or more), it returns immediately.
 *
 * Additionally to basic barriers, an abortion event is available.
 * barrier_abort() places an abortion event that cannot be undone. An abortion
 * immediately cancels all placed barriers and replaces them. Any running and
 * following wait/sync call besides barrier_wait_abortion() will immediately
 * return false on both sides (otherwise, they always return true).
 * barrier_abort() can be called multiple times on both ends and will be a
 * no-op if already called on this side.
 * barrier_wait_abortion() can be used to wait for the other side to call
 * barrier_abort() and is the only wait/sync call that does not return
 * immediately if we aborted outself. It only returns once the other side
 * called barrier_abort().
 *
 * Barriers can be used for in-process and inter-process synchronization.
 * However, for in-process synchronization you could just use mutexes.
 * Therefore, main target is IPC and we require both sides to *not* share the FD
 * table. If that's given, barriers provide target tracking: If the remote side
 * exit()s, an abortion event is implicitly queued on the other side. This way,
 * a sync/wait call will be woken up if the remote side crashed or exited
 * unexpectedly. However, note that these abortion events are only queued if the
 * barrier-queue has been drained. Therefore, it is safe to place a barrier and
 * exit. The other side can safely wait on the barrier even though the exit
 * queued an abortion event. Usually, the abortion event would overwrite the
 * barrier, however, that's not true for exit-abortion events. Those are only
 * queued if the barrier-queue is drained (thus, the receiving side has placed
 * more barriers than the remote side).

 * Two eventfd objects are allocated for each barrier. If allocation fails, an
