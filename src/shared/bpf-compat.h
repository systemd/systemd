 *  - having helpers that automatically use the appropriate version behind the
 *    new API for easy cleanup later
 *
 * The advantage of doing this instead of only looking for the symbols declared at
 * compile time is that we can then load either the old or the new symbols at runtime
 * regardless of the version we were compiled with */
