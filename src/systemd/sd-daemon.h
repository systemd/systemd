/*
  Informs systemd about changed daemon state. This takes a number of
  newline separated environment-style variable assignments in a
  string. The following variables are known:

     READY=1      Tells systemd that daemon startup is finished (only
                  relevant for services of Type=notify). The passed
                  argument is a boolean "1" or "0". Since there is
                  little value in signaling non-readiness the only
                  value daemons should send is "READY=1".

     STATUS=...   Passes a single-line status string back to systemd
                  that describes the daemon state. This is free-form
                  and can be used for various purposes: general state
                  feedback, fsck-like programs could pass completion
                  percentages and failing programs could pass a human
                  readable error message. Example: "STATUS=Completed
                  66% of file system check..."

     ERRNO=...    If a daemon fails, the errno-style error code,
                  formatted as string. Example: "ERRNO=2" for ENOENT.

     BUSERROR=... If a daemon fails, the D-Bus error-style error
                  code. Example: "BUSERROR=org.freedesktop.DBus.Error.TimedOut"

     MAINPID=...  The main pid of a daemon, in case systemd did not
                  fork off the process itself. Example: "MAINPID=4711"

     WATCHDOG=1   Tells systemd to update the watchdog timestamp.
                  Services using this feature should do this in
                  regular intervals. A watchdog framework can use the
                  timestamps to detect failed services. Also see
                  sd_watchdog_enabled() below.

     FDSTORE=1    Store the file descriptors passed along with the
                  message in the per-service file descriptor store,
                  and pass them to the main process again on next
                  invocation. This variable is only supported with
                  sd_pid_notify_with_fds().

  Daemons can choose to send additional variables. However, it is
  recommended to prefix variable names not listed above with X_.

  Returns a negative errno-style error code on failure. Returns > 0
  if systemd could be notified, 0 if it couldn't possibly because
  systemd is not running.

  Example: When a daemon finished starting up, it could issue this
  call to notify systemd about it:

     sd_notify(0, "READY=1");

  See sd_notifyf() for more complete examples.

  See sd_notify(3) for more information.
*/
int sd_notify(int unset_environment, const char *state);

/*
  Similar to sd_notify() but takes a format string.

  Example 1: A daemon could send the following after initialization:

     sd_notifyf(0, "READY=1\n"
                   "STATUS=Processing requests...\n"
                   "MAINPID=%lu",
                   (unsigned long) getpid());

  Example 2: A daemon could send the following shortly before
  exiting, on failure:

     sd_notifyf(0, "STATUS=Failed to start up: %s\n"
                   "ERRNO=%i",
                   strerror(errno),
                   errno);

  Returns > 0 if the system was booted with systemd. Returns < 0 on

  that all of the functions above handle non-systemd boots just
  fine. You should NOT protect them with a call to this function. Also
  note that this function checks whether the system, not the user
  session is controlled by systemd. However the functions above work

  events to be sent regularly via sd_notify(0, "WATCHDOG=1"). Returns
  0 if it does not expect this. If the usec argument is non-NULL
  returns the watchdog timeout in µs after which the service manager
  will act on a process that has not sent a watchdog keep alive
  message. This function is useful to implement services that
  recognize automatically if they are being run under supervision of
  systemd with WatchdogSec= set. It is recommended for clients to
  generate keep-alive pings via sd_notify(0, "WATCHDOG=1") every half
  of the returned time.
