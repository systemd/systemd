/*
  Informs systemd about changed daemon state. This takes a number of
  newline separated environment-style variable assignments in a
  string. The following variables are known:

     MAINPID=...  The main PID of a daemon, in case systemd did not
                  fork off the process itself. Example: "MAINPID=4711"

     READY=1      Tells systemd that daemon startup or daemon reload
                  is finished (only relevant for services of Type=notify).
                  The passed argument is a boolean "1" or "0". Since there
                  is little value in signaling non-readiness the only
                  value daemons should send is "READY=1".

     RELOADING=1  Tell systemd that the daemon began reloading its
                  configuration. When the configuration has been
                  reloaded completely, READY=1 should be sent to inform
                  systemd about this.

     STOPPING=1   Tells systemd that the daemon is about to go down.

     STATUS=...   Passes a single-line status string back to systemd
                  that describes the daemon state. This is free-form
                  and can be used for various purposes: general state
                  feedback, fsck-like programs could pass completion
                  percentages and failing programs could pass a human
                  readable error message. Example: "STATUS=Completed
                  66% of file system check..."

     NOTIFYACCESS=...
                  Reset the access to the service status notification socket.
                  Example: "NOTIFYACCESS=main"

     ERRNO=...    If a daemon fails, the errno-style error code,
                  formatted as string. Example: "ERRNO=2" for ENOENT.

     BUSERROR=... If a daemon fails, the D-Bus error-style error
                  code. Example: "BUSERROR=org.freedesktop.DBus.Error.TimedOut"

     WATCHDOG=1   Tells systemd to update the watchdog timestamp.
                  Services using this feature should do this in
                  regular intervals. A watchdog framework can use the
                  timestamps to detect failed services. Also see
                  sd_watchdog_enabled() below.

     WATCHDOG_USEC=...
                  Reset watchdog_usec value during runtime.
                  To reset watchdog_usec value, start the service again.
                  Example: "WATCHDOG_USEC=20000000"

     FDSTORE=1    Store the file descriptors passed along with the
                  message in the per-service file descriptor store,
                  and pass them to the main process again on next
                  invocation. This variable is only supported with
                  sd_pid_notify_with_fds().

     FDSTOREREMOVE=1
                  Remove one or more file descriptors from the file
                  descriptor store, identified by the name specified
                  in FDNAME=, see below.

     FDNAME=      A name to assign to new file descriptors stored in the
                  file descriptor store, or the name of the file descriptors
                  to remove in case of FDSTOREREMOVE=1.

  Daemons can choose to send additional variables. However, it is
  recommended to prefix variable names not listed above with X_.

  Returns a negative errno-style error code on failure. Returns > 0
  if systemd could be notified, 0 if it couldn't possibly because
  systemd is not running.

  Example: When a daemon finished starting up, it could issue this
  call to notify systemd about it:

     sd_notify(0, "READY=1");

  See sd_notifyf() for more complete examples.

  See sd_notify(3) for more information.
*/

                   "MAINPID=%lu",

     sd_notifyf(0, "STATUS=Failed to start up: %s\n"
