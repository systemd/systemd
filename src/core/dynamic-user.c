         * needed, and in the child process we fork off, since allocation involves NSS checks which are not OK to do
         * from PID 1. To allow the children and PID 1 share information about allocated UIDs we use an anonymous
         * AF_UNIX/SOCK_DGRAM socket (called the "storage socket") that contains at most one datagram with the
         * allocated UID number, plus an fd referencing the lock file for the UID
         * (i.e. /run/systemd/dynamic-uid/$UID). Why involve the socket pair? So that PID 1 and all its children can
         * share the same storage for the UID and lock fd, simply by inheriting the storage socket fds. The socket pair
         * may exist in three different states:
         *
         * a) no datagram stored. This is the initial state. In this case the dynamic user was never realized.
         *
         * b) a datagram containing a UID stored, but no lock fd attached to it. In this case there was already a
         *    statically assigned UID by the same name, which we are reusing.
         *
         * c) a datagram containing a UID stored, and a lock fd is attached to it. In this case we allocated a dynamic
         *    UID and locked it in the file system, using the lock fd.
         *
         * As PID 1 and various children might access the socket pair simultaneously, and pop the datagram or push it
         * back in any time, we also maintain a lock on the socket pair. Note one peculiarity regarding locking here:
         * the UID lock on disk is protected via a BSD file lock (i.e. an fd-bound lock), so that the lock is kept in
         * place as long as there's a reference to the fd open. The lock on the storage socket pair however is a POSIX
         * file lock (i.e. a process-bound lock), as all users share the same fd of this (after all it is anonymous,
         * nobody else could get any access to it except via our own fd) and we want to synchronize access between all
         * processes that have access to it. */
