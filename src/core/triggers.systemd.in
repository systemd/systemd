%transfiletriggerin -P 900900 -p <lua> -- @systemunitdir@ /etc/systemd/system
-- This script will run after any package is initially installed or
-- upgraded. We care about the case where a package is initially
-- installed, because other cases are covered by the *un scriptlets,
-- so sometimes we will reload needlessly.

%transfiletriggerun -p <lua> -- @systemunitdir@ /etc/systemd/system
-- On removal, we need to run daemon-reload after any units have been
-- removed. %transfiletriggerpostun would be ideal, but it does not get
-- executed for some reason.
-- On upgrade, we need to run daemon-reload after any new unit files
-- have been installed, but before %postun scripts in packages get
-- executed. %transfiletriggerun gets the right list of files
-- but it is invoked too early (before changes happen).
-- %filetriggerpostun happens at the right time, but it fires for
-- every package.
-- To execute the reload at the right time, we create a state
-- file in %transfiletriggerun and execute the daemon-reload in
-- the first %filetriggerpostun.
