  <description>
    The default policy of "ACCEPT" allows all packets to/from
    interfaces in the zone to be forwarded, while the (*low priority*)
    reject rule blocks any traffic destined for the host, except those
    services explicitly listed (that list can be modified as required
    by the local admin). This zone is intended to be used only by
    systemd-networkd virtual networks.
