/* An embeddable structure carrying a reference to a process. Supposed to be used when tracking processes
 * continuously. This combines a PID, a modern Linux pidfd and the 64bit inode number of the pidfd into one
 * structure. Note that depending on kernel support the pidfd might not be initialized, and if it is
 * initialized then fd_id might still not be initialized (because the concept was added to the kernel much
 * later than pidfds themselves).
 *
 * There are three special states a PidRef can be in:
 *
 * 1. It can be *unset*. Use pidref_is_set() to detect this case. Most operations attempted on such a PidRef
 *    will fail with -ESRCH. Use PIDREF_NULL for initializing a PidRef in this state.
 *
 * 2. It can be marked as *automatic*. This is a special state indicating that a process reference is
 *    supposed to be derived automatically from the current context. This is used by the Varlink/JSON
 *    dispatcher as indication that a PidRef shall be derived from the connection peer, but might be
 *    otherwise used too. When marked *automatic* the PidRef will also be considered *unset*, hence most
 *    operations will fail with -ESRCH, as above.
 *
 * 3. It can be marked as *remote*. This is useful when deserializing a PidRef structure from an IPC message
 *    or similar, and it has been determined that the given PID definitely doesn't refer to a local
 *    process. In this case the PidRef logic will refrain from trying to acquire a pidfd for the
 *    process. Moreover, most operations will fail with -EREMOTE. Only PidRef structures that are not marked
 *    *unset* can be marked *remote*.
