# Global OpenRC configuration settings

# Set to "YES" if you want the rc system to try and start services
# in parallel for a slight speed improvement. When running in parallel we
# prefix the service output with its name as the output will get
# jumbled up.
# WARNING: whilst we have improved parallel, it can still potentially lock
# the boot process. Don't file bugs about this unless you can supply
# patches that fix it without breaking other things!
#rc_parallel="NO"

# Set rc_interactive to "YES" and you'll be able to press the I key during
# boot so you can choose to start specific services. Set to "NO" to disable
# this feature. This feature is automatically disabled if rc_parallel is
# set to YES.
#rc_interactive="YES"

# If we need to drop to a shell, you can specify it here.
# If not specified we use $SHELL, otherwise the one specified in /etc/passwd,
# otherwise /bin/sh
# Linux users could specify /sbin/sulogin
#rc_shell=/bin/sh

# Do we allow any started service in the runlevel to satisfy the dependency
# or do we want all of them regardless of state? For example, if net.eth0
# and net.eth1 are in the default runlevel then with rc_depend_strict="NO"
# both will be started, but services that depend on 'net' will work if either
# one comes up. With rc_depend_strict="YES" we would require them both to
# come up.
#rc_depend_strict="YES"

# rc_hotplug controls which services we allow to be hotplugged.
# A hotplugged service is one started by a dynamic dev manager when a matching
# hardware device is found.
# Hotplugged services appear in the "hotplugged" runlevel.
# If rc_hotplug is set to any value, we compare the name of this service
# to every pattern in the value, from left to right, and we allow the
# service to be hotplugged if it matches a pattern, or if it matches no
# patterns. Patterns can include shell wildcards.
# To disable services from being hotplugged, prefix patterns with "!".
#If rc_hotplug is not set or is empty, all hotplugging is disabled.
# Example - rc_hotplug="net.wlan !net.*"
# This allows net.wlan and any service not matching net.* to be hotplugged.
# Example - rc_hotplug="!net.*"
# This allows services that do not match "net.*" to be hotplugged.

# rc_logger launches a logging daemon to log the entire rc process to
# /var/log/rc.log
# NOTE: Linux systems require the devfs service to be started before
# logging can take place and as such cannot log the sysinit runlevel.
#rc_logger="NO"

# Through rc_log_path you can specify a custom log file.
# The default value is: /var/log/rc.log
#rc_log_path="/var/log/rc.log"

# If you want verbose output for OpenRC, set this to yes. If you want
# verbose output for service foo only, set it to yes in /etc/conf.d/foo.
#rc_verbose=no

# By default we filter the environment for our running scripts. To allow other
# variables through, add them here. Use a * to allow all variables through.
#rc_env_allow="VAR1 VAR2"

# By default we assume that all daemons will start correctly.
# However, some do not - a classic example is that they fork and return 0 AND
# then child barfs on a configuration error. Or the daemon has a bug and the
# child crashes. You can set the number of milliseconds start-stop-daemon
# waits to check that the daemon is still running after starting here.
# The default is 0 - no checking.
#rc_start_wait=100

# rc_nostop is a list of services which will not stop when changing runlevels.
# This still allows the service itself to be stopped when called directly.
#rc_nostop=""

# rc will attempt to start crashed services by default.
# However, it will not stop them by default as that could bring down other
# critical services.
#rc_crashed_stop=NO
#rc_crashed_start=YES

# Set rc_nocolor to yes if you do not want colors displayed in OpenRC
# output.
#rc_nocolor=NO

# SERVICE CONFIGURATION VARIABLES
# These variables are documented here, but should be configured in
# /etc/conf.d/foo for service foo and NOT enabled here unless you
# really want them to work on a global basis.
# If your service has characters in its name which are not legal in
# shell variable names and you configure the variables for it in this
# file, those characters should be replaced with underscores in the
# variable names as shown below.

# Some daemons are started and stopped via start-stop-daemon.
# We can set some things on a per service basis, like the nicelevel.
#SSD_NICELEVEL="-19"
# Or the ionice level. The format is class[:data] , just like the
# --ionice start-stop-daemon parameter.
#SSD_IONICELEVEL="2:2"

# Pass ulimit parameters
# If you are using bash in POSIX mode for your shell, note that the
# ulimit command uses a block size of 512 bytes for the -c and -f
# options
#rc_ulimit="-u 30"

# It's possible to define extra dependencies for services like so
#rc_config="/etc/foo"
#rc_need="openvpn"
#rc_use="net.eth0"
#rc_after="clock"
#rc_before="local"
#rc_provide="!net"

# You can also enable the above commands here for each service. Below is an
# example for service foo.
#rc_foo_config="/etc/foo"
#rc_foo_need="openvpn"
#rc_foo_after="clock"

# Below is an example for service foo-bar. Note that the '-' is illegal
# in a shell variable name, so we convert it to an underscore.
# example for service foo-bar.
#rc_foo_bar_config="/etc/foo-bar"
#rc_foo_bar_need="openvpn"
#rc_foo_bar_after="clock"

# You can also remove dependencies.
# This is mainly used for saying which services do NOT provide net.
#rc_net_tap0_provide="!net"

# This is the subsystem type.
# It is used to match against keywords set by the keyword call in the
# depend function of service scripts.
#
# It should be set to the value representing the environment this file is
# PRESENTLY in, not the virtualization the environment is capable of.
# If it is commented out, automatic detection will be used.

# The list below shows all possible settings as well as the host
# operating systems where they can be used and autodetected.

# This is a global setting.
#rc_cgroup_controllers=""

# This variable contains the cgroups version 2 settings for your services.

#
# For more information about the adjustments that can be made with

#rc_cggroup_memory_use_hierarchy="NO"

# The following settings allow you to set up values for the cgroups version 1

# They can be set in this file;, however, if you do this, the settings
# will apply to all of your services.
# If you want different settings for each service, place the settings in
# /etc/conf.d/foo for service foo.
# The format is to specify the names of the settings followed by their

#rc_cgroup_pids=""

# Set this to YES if you want all of the processes in a service's cgroup

# child processes will be killed. Keep this in mind if you set this to
# yes here instead of for the individual services in

# To perform this cleanup manually for a stopped service, you can
# execute cgroup_cleanup with /etc/init.d/<service> cgroup_cleanup or
# rc-service <service> cgroup_cleanup.
# The process followed in this cleanup is the following:
# 1. send stopsig (sigterm if it isn't set) to all processes left in the
# cgroup immediately followed by sigcont.
# 2. Send sighup to all processes in the cgroup if rc_send_sighup is
# yes.
# 3. delay for rc_timeout_stopsec seconds.
# 4. send sigkill to all processes in the cgroup unless disabled by
# setting rc_send_sigkill to no.
# rc_cgroup_cleanup="NO"

# If this is yes, we will send sighup to the processes in the cgroup
# immediately after stopsig and sigcont.
#rc_send_sighup="NO"

# This is the amount of time in seconds that we delay after sending sigcont
# and optionally sighup, before we optionally send sigkill to all
