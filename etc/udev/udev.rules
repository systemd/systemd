# There are a number of modifiers that are allowed to be used in the NAME or PROGRAM fields.
# They provide the following subsitutions:
# %n - the "kernel number" of the device.
#      for example, 'sda3' has a "kernel number" of '3'
# %k - the kernel name for the device.
# %M - the kernel major number for the device
# %m - the kernel minor number for the device
# %b - the bus id for the device
# %c - the return value for the CALLOUT program (note, this doesn't work within
#      the PROGRAM field for the obvious reason.)
# %D - use the devfs style disk name for this device.
#      For partitions, this will result in 'part%n'
#      If this is not a partition, it will result in 'disc'
