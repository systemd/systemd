1. Introduction
---------------

Libsysfs' purpose is to provide a consistent and stable interface for
querying system device information exposed through the sysfs filesystem.
The library implements functions for querying filesystem information, 
such as reading directories and files. It also contains routines for
working with buses, classes, and the device tree. 


2. Requirements
---------------

The library must satisfy the following requirements:

- It must provide a stable programming interfaces that applications can
  be built upon. 

- It must provide functions to retrieve device Vital Product Data (VPD)
  information for Error Log Analysis (ELA) support. ELA will provide
  device driver and device bus address information.

- It must provide access to all system devices and information exposed
  by sysfs.

- It must provide a function to find sysfs' current mount point.

- It must provide a function for udev to retrieve a device's major and
  minor numbers.


3. Definitions
--------------

- sysfs: Sysfs is a virtual filesystem in 2.5+ Linux kernels that 
  presents a hierarchical representation of all system physical and
  virtual devices. It presents system devices by bus, by class, and
  by topology. Callbacks to device drivers are exposed as files in
  device directories. Sysfs, for all purposes, is our tree of system
  devices. For more information, please see:

	http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/mochel/doc/

- udev: Udev is Greg Kroah-Hartman's User Space implementation of devfs.
  Udev creates /dev nodes for devices upon Hotplug events. The Hotplug
  event provides udev with a sysfs directory location of the device. Udev
  must use that directory to grab device's major and minor number, which it
  will use to create the /dev node. For more information, please see:

	http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/utils/kernel/hotplug/

  Udev provides persistent device naming based on a set of user specified
  rules. The rules a device name is based on could one or a combination of a
  number of parameters such as the bus the device is on, the serial number 
  of the device (in case of USB), the vendor name (in case of SCSI) and so
  on. Udev uses Libsysfs to retrieve relevent information to appropriately
  name devices.


4. Overview
-----------

Libsysfs grew from a common need. There are several applications under
development that need access to sysfs and system devices. Udev, on a
hotplug event, must take a sysfs device path and create a /dev node. Our
diagnostic client needs to list all system devices. Finally, our Error
Log Analysis piece is required to retrieve VPD information for a 
failing device. We divided to create a single library interface rather 
than having these separate applications create their own accesses to 
sysfs involving reading directories and files.

Libsysfs will also provide stability for applications to be built upon. Sysfs
currently doesn't enforce any standards for callback or file names. File
names change depending on bus or class. Sysfs is also changing, it is
currently being developed. Libsysfs will provide a stable interface to
applications while allowing sysfs to change underneath it.

Like sysfs, the library will provide devices to applications by bus, by
class, and by topology. The library will function similar to directories
and files that lie underneath it. To query a device on a PCI bus, one would
"open" the bus to scan or read devices and "close" the bus when 
completed. Besides supplying functions to retrieve devices, the library
will also provide some utility functions like getting sysfs mount point.

A paper on Libsysfs was presented at Linux.Conf.Au 2004 (Adelaide, January
2004). The paper is available online at:

http://oss.software.ibm.com/linux/papers/libsysfs/libsysfs-linuxconfau2004.pdf


5. Data Structures
------------------

Libsysfs will classify system devices following sysfs' example, dividing 
them by bus, class, and devices. The library presents this information
generically. It doesn't, for example, differentiate between PCI and USB 
buses. Device attributes are presented with values as they are exposed
by sysfs, the values are not formatted.

The library will provide standard definitions for working with sysfs
and devices, here's some examples:

#define SYSFS_FSTYPE_NAME       "sysfs"
#define SYSFS_PROC_MNTS         "/proc/mounts"
#define SYSFS_BUS_NAME          "bus"
#define SYSFS_CLASS_NAME        "class"
#define SYSFS_BLOCK_NAME        "block"
#define SYSFS_DEVICES_NAME      "devices"
#define SYSFS_DRIVERS_NAME      "drivers"
#define SYSFS_NAME_ATTRIBUTE    "name"

The library uses some definitions to mark maximum size of a sysfs name or
path length:

#define SYSFS_PATH_MAX          255
#define SYSFS_NAME_LEN          50
#define SYSFS_BUS_ID_SIZE       20


NOTE:
     a. As of release 0.4.0 of sysfsutils, a number of changes have been 
	made so that the dlists and "directory" references in all libsysfs's 
	structures are not populated until such time that it is absolutely
	necessary. Hence, these elements may not contain valid data at all
	times (as was the case before).
     b. As of release 1.0.0 of sysfsutils, all dlists in the library are
	sorted in alphabetical order. It is now a requirement that the 
	"name" and "path" be the first two elements of all libsysfs
	structures.


5.1 Directory and Attribute Data Structures
-------------------------------------------

The library implements structures to represent sysfs directories, links, 
and files. 


5.1.1 Attribute Structure
-------------------------

A file in sysfs represents a device or driver attribute. Attributes can be
read only, write only, or read and write. File data can be ASCII and 
binary. The library has the following structure to represent files:

struct sysfs_attribute {
        char name[SYSFS_NAME_LEN];
        char path[SYSFS_PATH_MAX];
        char *value;
        unsigned short len;             /* value length */
        unsigned short method;          /* show and store */
};

Path represents the file/attribute's full path. Value is used when reading
from or writing to an attribute. "len" is the length of data in "value". 
Method is a bitmask for defining if the attribute supports show(read) 
and/or store(write). 


5.1.2 Link Structure
--------------------

Symbolic links are used in sysfs to link bus or class views with 
particular devices. 

struct sysfs_link {
        char name[SYSFS_NAME_LEN];
        char path[SYSFS_PATH_MAX];
        char target[SYSFS_PATH_MAX];
};

Link's name is stored in "name' and it's target stored in "target". Absolute 
path to the link is stored in "path".


5.1.3 Directory Structure
-------------------------

The directory structure represents a sysfs directory:

struct sysfs_directory {
        char name[SYSFS_NAME_LEN];
        char path[SYSFS_PATH_MAX];

	/* Private: for internal use only */
        struct dlist *subdirs;
        struct dlist *links;
        struct dlist *attributes;
};

The sysfs_directory structure includes the list of subdirectories, links and
attributes. The "name" and absolute "path" are also stored in the structure.
The sysfs_directory structure is intended for use internal to the library.
Applications needing access to attributes and links from the directory
will need to make appropriate calls (described below) to get the same.


5.2 Bus Data Structure
----------------------

All buses look similar in sysfs including lists of devices and drivers,
therefore we use the following structure to represent all sysfs buses:

struct sysfs_bus {
        char name[SYSFS_NAME_LEN];
        char path[SYSFS_PATH_MAX];

        /* Private: for internal use only */
        struct dlist *drivers;
        struct dlist *devices;
        struct sysfs_directory *directory;
};

The sysfs_bus structure contains the bus "name", while the "path" to bus 
directory is also stored. It also contains lists of devices on the bus 
and drivers that are registered on it. The bus' directory is represented 
by the sysfs_directory structure and it contains references to all the 
subdirectories, links, and attributes. The sysfs_directory structure 
is for internal use only. The following functions may be used by 
applications to retrieve data from the sysfs_directory structure:

struct dlist *sysfs_get_bus_attributes(struct sysfs_bus *bus)
struct sysfs_attribute *sysfs_get_bus_attribute(struct sysfs_bus *bus,
						char *attrname)


5.3 Class Data Structures
-------------------------

The library uses two data structures to represent classes in sysfs. Sysfs
classes contains a class directory like "net" or "scsi_host" and then
class devices like "eth0", "lo", or "eth1" for the "net" class.

struct sysfs_class {
        char name[SYSFS_NAME_LEN];
        char path[SYSFS_PATH_MAX];

        /* Private: for internal use only */
        struct dlist *devices;
        struct sysfs_directory *directory;
};

The sysfs_class represents device classes in sysfs like "net". It contains  
the class "name", "path" to the class, a list of class devices and the 
directory representation (for internal use only). 

struct sysfs_class_device {
        char name[SYSFS_NAME_LEN];
        char path[SYSFS_PATH_MAX];
        char classname[SYSFS_NAME_LEN];

        /* Private: for internal use only */
	struct sysfs_class_device *parent;
        struct sysfs_device *sysdevice;         /* NULL if virtual */
        struct sysfs_driver *driver;            /* NULL if not implemented */
        struct sysfs_directory *directory;
};

A class device isn't the same as a sysfs_device, it's specific to the class in 
which it belongs. The class device structure contains the name of the class
the class device belongs to, its sysfs_device reference and that device's 
driver reference (if any). It also contains the name of the class device 
- like "eth0", its parent point (if present) and its sysfs directory 
information including links and attributes (for internal use only). 
The following function may be used by applications to retrieve data
from the sysfs_directory structure:

struct dlist *sysfs_get_classdev_attributes(struct sysfs_class_device *cdev);


5.4 Root Device Data Structure
------------------------------

Device hierarchies in sysfs are represented under the /sys/devices directory 
structure. Sysfs devices typically spawn off from base devices which are 
represented by a sysfs_root_device. 

struct sysfs_root_device {
        char name[SYSFS_NAME_LEN];
        char path[SYSFS_PATH_MAX];

        /* Private: for internal use only */
        struct dlist *devices;
        struct sysfs_directory *directory;
};

The sysfs_root_device structure contains a list of "devices" that spawn off it.
The name of the root device as represented under /sys/devices is read into 
"name" and the absolute path into "path" and its sysfs_directory information 
intended to be used internal to the library. 


5.5 Device Data Structure
-------------------------

The sysfs_device structure represents a system device that's exposed
in sysfs under the /sys/devices directory structure.

struct sysfs_device {
        char name[SYSFS_NAME_LEN];
        char path[SYSFS_PATH_MAX];
        char bus_id[SYSFS_NAME_LEN];
        char bus[SYSFS_NAME_LEN];
        char driver_name[SYSFS_NAME_LEN];

        /* Private: for internal use only */
        struct sysfs_device *parent;
        struct dlist *children;
        struct sysfs_directory *directory;
};

The sysfs_device structure contains a "parent" pointer, a list of child
devices, if any, device's directory, its bus id - which is the name of 
device's directory, the bus name on which this device is registered and 
its driver name. The device structure also contains the absolute path
to the device and a directory structure, which contains a list of the 
device's attributes (for internal use only). The following functions 
may be used to obtain information from sysfs_directory structure:

struct sysfs_attribute *sysfs_get_device_attribute(struct sysfs_device *dev,
						const char *name)
struct dlist *sysfs_get_device_attributes(struct sysfs_device *device)


5.6 Driver Data Structure
-------------------------

The sysfs_driver structure represents a device driver.

struct sysfs_driver {
        char name[SYSFS_NAME_LEN];
        char path[SYSFS_PATH_MAX];

        /* Private: for internal use only */
        struct dlist *devices;
        struct sysfs_directory *directory;
};

The sysfs_driver structure contains a list of devices that use this driver,
the name of the driver, its path, and its directory information, which 
includes the driver's attributes (for internal use only). The following
function may be used to retrieve driver attribute information from the
sysfs_directory structure:

struct dlist *sysfs_get_driver_attributes(struct sysfs_driver *driver)


6. Functions
------------

Libsysfs will provide functions to access system devices by bus, by class,
and by device. Functions will act like accessing directories and files, 
using "open" and "close". Open returns a structure and close is used
to clean that structure up.


6.1 Calling Conventions in Libsysfs
-----------------------------------

Libsysfs uses a simple API calling convention. APIs are classified to be 
one of "open", "get", "close" types. The convention is as follows:

	a. All "open" APIs have a corresponding "close" API.
	b. References obtained using "get" calls should not be closed
		explicitly.
	c. All "opened" references have to be closed with a call to
		their corresponding "close" call. This takes care of
		freeing structure references obtained with "get" calls.

6.3.2 Link Functions
--------------------

Sysfs contains many symbolic links, like bus links to bus devices. Libsysfs
treats links differently than directories due to processing differences. A
link in the /sys/bus/"busname"/devices/ directory indicates a device in the
/sys/devices directory. Through links we give the functionality to know
what is and what isn't a link and the ability to query the links target.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Name:		sysfs_close_link

Description:	Closes a directory link structure.

7 Dlists
--------

Libsysfs uses (yet another) list implementation thanks to Eric J Bohm.


7.1 Navigating a dlist
----------------------

Some library functions return a dlist of devices/drivers/attributes, etc.
To navigate the list returned the macro "dlist_for_each_data" is to be used.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Function/Macro name:    dlist_for_each_data

Description:            Walk the given list, returning a known data type/
                        structure in each iteration.

Arguments:              struct dlist *list      List pointer
                        data_iterator           Data type/structure variable
			                        contained in the list
			datatype                Data type/structure contained
						in the list

Returns:                On each iteration, "data_iterator" will contain a list
			element of "datatype"

Usage example:          The function sysfs_get_classdev_attributes() returns a
			dlist of attributes. To navigate the list:
				
			struct sysfs_attribute *attr = NULL;
			struct dlist *attrlist = NULL;
			.
			.
			.
			attrlist = sysfs_get_classdev_attributes
					(struct sysfs_class_device *cdev)
			if (attrlist != NULL) {
				dlist_for_each_data(attrlist, attr,
						struct sysfs_attribute) {
				.
				.
				.
				}
			}
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


7.2 Custom sorting using dlist_sort_custom()
--------------------------------------------

As of release 1.2.0, libsysfs provides a new interface for custom sorting
of dlists. The API dlist_sort_custom() has been added for this purpose.
Applications that would like to define their own sorter function can now
make use of this API.

The sorter function must conform to the following prototype:

	int compare(void *a, void*b)

dlist_sort_custom() expects that the compare function will:
	return >0 for a before b
	return <0 for b before a
	return  0 for a == b


8. Usage
--------

Accessing devices through libsysfs is supposed to mirror accessing devices
in the filesystem it represents. Here's a typical order of operation:

	- get sysfs mount point
	- "open" sysfs category, ie. bus, class, or device
	- work with category
	- "close" sysfs category


9. Testsuite
------------

Version 1.0.0 of sysfsutils ships with a comprehensive testsuite. The testsuite
shipped as part of the "test" directory of the sysfsutils source package,
results in an executable "testlibsysfs" which will be installed in the
/usr/local/bin directory. Some of the salient features of the testsuite are:

a. Tests _every_ API exported by the library.
b. Tests are performed for all possible combinations of input parameters.
c. Detailed output is provided for the correct case.
d. Facility to redirect output of the tests to a normal file.
e. Number of iterations of tests can be specified.

The testsuite comes with its own configuration file "libsysfs.conf" in the
"test" directory. This file is used to generate a header file at the time
the tests are built. 

To use the testsuite:

a. Modify the variables libsysfs.conf file to appropriate values for your
   system. (The libsysfs.conf file contains comments describing what each
   variable stands for and, in some cases, how to determine an appropriate 
   value for the system under test).

b. Build and install the testsuite.

c. Run the testsuite:

	testlibsysfs <number of iterations> <logfile>

The default logfile is stdout.

NOTE: If the libsysfs.conf file is changed, make sure to run "make clean" in 
the test directory and then a "make" for the changes to take effect.


10. Conclusion
--------------

Libsysfs is meant to provide a stable application programming interface to
sysfs. Applications can depend upon the library to access system devices
and functions exposed through sysfs.
