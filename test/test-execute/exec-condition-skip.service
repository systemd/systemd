Description=Test for exec condition that triggers skipping

[Service]
Type=oneshot

# exit codes [1, 254] will result in skipping the rest of execution
ExecCondition=bash -c 'exit 0'
ExecCondition=bash -c 'exit 254'

# This would normally fail the unit but will not get run due to the skip above
ExecCondition=bash -c 'exit 255'

# This should not get run
ExecStart=bash -c 'true'
