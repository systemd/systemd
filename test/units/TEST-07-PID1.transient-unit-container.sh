# Test: PID-1 Transient Unit Container
#
# Verifies that a minimal systemd PID 1 inside a tmpfs root can:
#   • Boot
#   • Bind mount the host's /usr directory read-only
#   • Bind mount a shared writable directory with the host
#   • Run a one-shot service in the container to create and
#     write to a host file in that directory
#   • Exit cleanly with systemd-run --wait propagating status

    # IMPORTANT: This is modeled after a workaround in
    # TEST-07-PID1.private-pids.sh with a key difference. In private-pids, it's
    # explained there must be at least 1 unmasked procfs mount on the host in
    # order for /proc/ to be mounted by an UNPRIVILEGED user within the container
    # namespace. Note the host mount is not actually passed through to the
    # container.
    #
    # The key difference here is that, here, systemd-run is NOT launched with
    # --user, it is a PRIVILEGED environment and should not hit a permissions
    # error when attempting to mount /proc. Unfortunately, that's exactly what
    # happens if you launch the container without first mounting a dummy
    # unmasked /proc on the host.
    #
    # It was pointed out to me that this may indicate a significant bug. A
    # change masking the host's /proc could prevent the startup of privileged
    # containers. If this were addressed, this function could be removed.
