The extended testsuite only works with UID=0. It contains of several
subdirectories named "test/TEST-??-*", which are run one by one.

To run the extended testsuite do the following:

$ ninja -C build  # Avoid building anything as root later
$ sudo test/run-integration-tests.sh
ninja: Entering directory `/home/zbyszek/src/systemd/build'
ninja: no work to do.
--x-- Running TEST-01-BASIC --x--
+ make -C TEST-01-BASIC clean setup run
make: Entering directory '/home/zbyszek/src/systemd/test/TEST-01-BASIC'
TEST-01-BASIC CLEANUP: Basic systemd setup
TEST-01-BASIC SETUP: Basic systemd setup
...
TEST-01-BASIC RUN: Basic systemd setup [OK]
make: Leaving directory '/home/zbyszek/src/systemd/test/TEST-01-BASIC'
--x-- Result of TEST-01-BASIC: 0 --x--
--x-- Running TEST-02-CRYPTSETUP --x--
+ make -C TEST-02-CRYPTSETUP clean setup run

If one of the tests fails, then $subdir/test.log contains the log file of
the test.

To run just one of the cases:

$ sudo make -C test/TEST-01-BASIC clean setup run

Specifying the build directory
==============================

If the build directory is not detected automatically, it can be specified
with BUILD_DIR=:

$ sudo BUILD_DIR=some-other-build/ test/run-integration-tests

or

$ sudo make -C test/TEST-01-BASIC BUILD_DIR=../../some-other-build/ ...

Note that in the second case, the path is relative to the test case directory.
An absolute path may also be used in both cases.

Testing installed binaries instead of built
===========================================

To run the extended testsuite using the systemd installed on the system instead
of the systemd from a build, use the NO_BUILD=1:

$ sudo NO_BUILD=1 test/run-integration-tests

Configuration variables
=======================

TEST_NO_QEMU=1
    Don't run tests under QEMU

TEST_QEMU_ONLY=1
    Run only tests that require QEMU

TEST_NO_NSPAWN=1
    Don't run tests under systemd-nspawn

TEST_PREFER_NSPAWN=1
    Run all tests that do not require qemu under systemd-nspawn

TEST_NO_KVM=1
    Disable QEMU KVM auto-detection (may be necessary when you're trying to run the
    *vanilla* QEMU and have both qemu and qemu-kvm installed)

TEST_NESTED_KVM=1
    Allow tests to run with nested KVM. By default, the testsuite disables
    nested KVM if the host machine already runs under KVM. Setting this
    variable disables such checks

QEMU_MEM=512M
    Configure amount of memory for QEMU VMs (defaults to 512M)

QEMU_SMP=1
    Configure number of CPUs for QEMU VMs (defaults to 1)

KERNEL_APPEND='...'
    Append additional parameters to the kernel command line

NSPAWN_ARGUMENTS='...'
    Specify additional arguments for systemd-nspawn

QEMU_TIMEOUT=infinity
    Set a timeout for tests under QEMU (defaults to infinity)

NSPAWN_TIMEOUT=infinity
    Set a timeout for tests under systemd-nspawn (defaults to infinity)

INTERACTIVE_DEBUG=1
    Configure the machine to be more *user-friendly* for interactive debuggung
    (e.g. by setting a usable default terminal, suppressing the shutdown after
    the test, etc.)

The kernel and initramfs can be specified with $KERNEL_BIN and $INITRD.
(Fedora's or Debian's default kernel path and initramfs are used by default)

A script will try to find your QEMU binary. If you want to specify a different
one with $QEMU_BIN.

Debugging the qemu image
========================

If you want to log in the testsuite virtual machine, you can specify additional
kernel command line parameter with $KERNEL_APPEND and then log in as root.

$ sudo make -C test/TEST-01-BASIC KERNEL_APPEND="systemd.unit=multi-user.target" run

Root password is empty.

Ubuntu CI
=========

New PR submitted to the project are run through regression tests, and one set
of those is the 'autopkgtest' runs for several different architectures, called
'Ubuntu CI'.  Part of that testing is to run all these tests.  Sometimes these
tests are temporarily deny-listed from running in the 'autopkgtest' tests while
debugging a flaky test; that is done by creating a file in the test directory
named 'deny-list-ubuntu-ci', for example to prevent the TEST-01-BASIC test from
running in the 'autopkgtest' runs, create the file
'TEST-01-BASIC/deny-list-ubuntu-ci'.

The tests may be disabled only for specific archs, by creating a deny-list file
with the arch name at the end, e.g.
'TEST-01-BASIC/deny-list-ubuntu-ci-arm64' to disable the TEST-01-BASIC test
only on test runs for the 'arm64' architecture.

Note the arch naming is not from 'uname -m', it is Debian arch names:
https://wiki.debian.org/ArchitectureSpecificsMemo

For PRs that fix a currently deny-listed test, the PR should include removal
of the deny-list file.

In case a test fails, the full set of artifacts, including the journal of the
failed run, can be downloaded from the artifacts.tar.gz archive which will be
reachable in the same URL parent directory as the logs.gz that gets linked on
the Github CI status.

To add new dependencies or new binaries to the packages used during the tests,
a merge request can be sent to: https://salsa.debian.org/systemd-team/systemd
targeting the 'upstream-ci' branch.

The cloud-side infrastructure, that is hooked into the Github interface, is
located at:
