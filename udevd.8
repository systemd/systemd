.TH UDEVD 8 "February 2004" "" "Linux Administrator's Manual"
.SH NAME
udevd, udevdsend \- udev event serializer daemon and udev event sender
.SH SYNOPSIS
.BI udevsend " hotplug-subsystem"
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.B udevd
allows the serialization of
.BR hotplug (8)
events. The events generated by the kernel may arrive in random order
in userspace, that makes it neccessary to reorder them.
.br
.B udevd
takes care of the kernel supplied
.B SEQNUM
sequence number and arranges the events for execution in the correct order.
Missing sequences delay the execution of the following events until a timeout
is reached. Events without any sequence number are bypassing the queue and
will be executed immediately.
.br
For each event a
.BR udev (8)
instance is executed in the background with the complete environment received
by the hotplug event. All further events for the same device are delayed until
the execution is finished. This way there will never be more than one instance
running for a single device at the same time.
.br
.B udevd
receives the events from
.B udevsend
which is called by
.BR hotplug (8).
If
.B udevd
isn't already running,
.B udevsend
will start it.

was developed primarily by Kay Sievers <kay.sievers@vrfy.org>, with much help
from others.
