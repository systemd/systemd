# We collect metadata from /proc/%P/, and thus need to make sure the crashed
# processes are not reaped until we have finished collecting what we need. The
# kernel default for this sysctl is "0" which means the kernel doesn't wait for
# userspace to finish processing before reaping the crashed processes. With a
# higher setting the kernel will delay reaping until we are done, but only for
# the specified number of crashes in parallel. The value of 16 is chosen to
# match systemd-coredump.socket's MaxConnections= value.
