udev - userspace device management

For more information see the files in the docs/ directory.

Important Note:
  Integrating udev in the system is a whole lot of work, has complex dependencies
  and differs a lot from distro to distro. All major distros depend on udev these
  days and the system may not work without a proper installed version. The upstream
  udev project does not support or recomend to replace a distro's udev installation
  with the upstream version. The installation of a unmodified upstream version may
  render your system unusable. Until now, there is no "default" setup or a set of
  "default" rules provided by the upstream udev version.

Requirements:
  - 2.6.x version of the Linux kernel. See the RELEASE-NOTES file in the
    udev tree and the Documentation/Changes in the kernel source tree for
    the actual dependency.

  - The kernel must have sysfs and unix domain socket enabled.
    (unix domain sockets (CONFIG_UNIX) as a loadable kernel module may work,
     but it is completely silly - don't complain if anything goes wrong.)

  - The proc filesystem must be mounted on /proc.

  - The sysfs filesystem must be mounted at /sys. No other location
    will be supported by udev.


Operation:
  Udev creates and removes device nodes in /dev, based on events the kernel
  sends out on device discovery or removal.

  - Early in the boot process, the /dev directory should get a tmpfs
    filesystem mounted, which is populated from scratch by udev. Created nodes
    or changed permissions will not survive a reboot, which is intentional.

  - The content of /lib/udev/devices directory which contains the nodes,
    symlinks and directories, which are always expected to be in /dev, should
    be copied over to the tmpfs mounted /dev, to provide the required nodes
    to initialize udev and continue booting.

  - The udevd daemon must be started by an init script to receive netlink
    uevents from the kernel driver core.

  - From kernel version 2.6.15 on, the hotplug helper /sbin/hotplug should
    be disabled with an init script before actions like loading kernel
    modules are taken, which may cause a lot of events.

  - All kernel events are matched against a set of specified rules in
    /etc/udev/rules.d/ which make it possible to hook into the event
    processing to load required kernel modules and setup devices. For all
    devices the kernel exports a major/minor number, udev will create a
    device node with the default kernel name or the one specified by a
    matching udev rule.


Compile Options:
  DESTDIR
  	Prefix of install target, used for package building.
  USE_LOG
  	If set to 'true', udev is able to pass errors or debug information
  	to syslog. This is very useful to see what udev is doing or not doing.
  	It is enabled by default, don't expect any useful answer, if you
  	need to hunt a bug, but you can't enable syslog.
  DEBUG
  	If set to 'true', very verbose debugging messages will be compiled
  	into the udev binaries. The actual level of debugging is specified
  	in the udev config file.
  USE_SELINUX
  	If set to 'true', udev will be built with SELinux support
  	enabled.  This is disabled by default.
  EXTRAS
  	list of helper programs in extras/ to build.
        make EXTRAS="extras/cdrom_id extras/scsi_id extras/volume_id"


Installation:
  - The install target intalls the udev binaries in the default locations,
    All at boot time reqired binaries will be installed in /lib/udev or /sbin.

  - The default location for scripts and binaries that are called from
    rules is /lib/udev. Other packages who install udev rules, should use
    that directory too.

  - It is recommended to use the /lib/udev/devices directory to place
    device nodes and symlinks in, which are copied to /dev at every boot.
    That way, nodes for broken subsystems or devices which can't be
    detected automatically by the kernel, will always be available.

  - Copies of the rules files for the major distros are provided as examples
    in the etc/udev directory.

  - The persistent device naming links in /dev/disk/ are required by other
    software that depends on the data udev has collected from the devices
    and should be installed by default with every udev installation.
