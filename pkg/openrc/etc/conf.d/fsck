# Pass any arguments to fsck.
# By default we preen.
# Linux systems also force -C0 and -T.
# If fsck_args is not specified then Linux systems also use -A
# (and -R if / is rw)
#fsck_args="-p"

# We can also specify the passno in /etc/fstab to check
# If you multiplex fsck (ie ln -s fsck /etc/init.d/fsck.late) then you can
# do an fsck outside of the normal scope, say for /home.
# Here are some exampes:-
#fsck_passno="=1 =2"
#fsck_passno=">1"
#fsck_passno="<2"

# If passno is not enough granularity, you can also specify mountpoints to
# check. This should NOT be used for the default non-multiplexed fsck, or your
# system might not be checked. Additionally, it is mutually exclusive with
# the fsck_passno setting.
#fsck_mnt=""
#fsck_mnt="/home"

# Most modern fs's don't require a full fsck on boot, but for those that do
# it may be advisable to skip this when running on battery.
# WARNING: Do not turn this off if you have any JFS partitions.
fsck_on_battery="YES"

# fsck_shutdown causes fsck to trigger during shutdown as well as startup.
# The end result of this is that if any periodic non-root filesystem checks are
# scheduled, under normal circumstances the actual check will happen during
# shutdown rather than at next boot.
# This is useful when periodic filesystem checks are causing undesirable
# delays at startup, but such delays at shutdown are acceptable.
fsck_shutdown="NO"

# fsck_abort_on_errors can be set to no to cause fsck to not abort on
# errors.
# This is useful when periodic filesystem checks are causing undesirable
# aborts.
fsck_abort_on_errors="YES"
