    <title>Description</title>

    <para>A unit configuration file whose name ends in
    <literal>.socket</literal> encodes information about an IPC or
    network socket or a file system FIFO controlled and supervised by
    systemd, for socket-based activation.</para>

    <para>This man page lists the configuration options specific to
    this unit type. See
    <citerefentry><refentrytitle>systemd.unit</refentrytitle><manvolnum>5</manvolnum></citerefentry>
    for the common options of all unit configuration files. The common
    configuration items are configured in the generic [Unit] and
    [Install] sections. The socket specific configuration options are
    configured in the [Socket] section.</para>

    <para>Additional options are listed in
    <citerefentry><refentrytitle>systemd.exec</refentrytitle><manvolnum>5</manvolnum></citerefentry>,
    which define the execution environment the
    <option>ExecStartPre=</option>, <option>ExecStartPost=</option>,
    <option>ExecStopPre=</option> and <option>ExecStopPost=</option>
    commands are executed in, and in
    <citerefentry><refentrytitle>systemd.kill</refentrytitle><manvolnum>5</manvolnum></citerefentry>,
    which define the way the processes are terminated, and in
    <citerefentry><refentrytitle>systemd.resource-control</refentrytitle><manvolnum>5</manvolnum></citerefentry>,
    which configure resource control settings for the processes of the
    socket.</para>

    <para>For each socket file, a matching service file must exist,
    describing the service to start on incoming traffic on the socket
    (see
    <citerefentry><refentrytitle>systemd.service</refentrytitle><manvolnum>5</manvolnum></citerefentry>
    for more information about .service files). The name of the
    .service unit is by default the same as the name of the .socket
    unit, but can be altered with the <option>Service=</option> option
    described below. Depending on the setting of the
    <option>Accept=</option> option described below, this .service
    unit must either be named like the .socket unit, but with the
    suffix replaced, unless overridden with <option>Service=</option>;
    or it must be a template unit named the same way. Example: a
    socket file <filename>foo.socket</filename> needs a matching
    service <filename>foo.service</filename> if
    <option>Accept=false</option> is set. If
    <option>Accept=true</option> is set, a service template file
    <filename>foo@.service</filename> must exist from which services
    are instantiated for each incoming connection.</para>

    <para>Unless <varname>DefaultDependencies=</varname> is set to
    <option>false</option>, socket units will implicitly have
    dependencies of type <varname>Requires=</varname> and
    <varname>After=</varname> on <filename>sysinit.target</filename>
    as well as dependencies of type <varname>Conflicts=</varname> and
    <varname>Before=</varname> on
    <filename>shutdown.target</filename>. These ensure that socket
    units pull in basic system initialization, and are terminated
    cleanly prior to system shutdown. Only sockets involved with early
    boot or late system shutdown should disable this option.</para>

    <para>Socket units will have a <varname>Before=</varname>
    dependency on the service which they trigger added implicitly. No
    implicit <varname>WantedBy=</varname> or
    <varname>RequiredBy=</varname> dependency from the socket to the
    service is added. This means that the service may be started
    without the socket, in which case it must be able to open sockets
    by itself. To prevent this, an explicit
    <varname>Requires=</varname> dependency may be added.</para>

    <para>Socket units may be used to implement on-demand starting of
    services, as well as parallelized starting of services. See the
    blog stories linked at the end for an introduction.</para>

    <para>Note that the daemon software configured for socket
    activation with socket units needs to be able to accept sockets
    from systemd, either via systemd's native socket passing interface
    (see
    <citerefentry><refentrytitle>sd_listen_fds</refentrytitle><manvolnum>3</manvolnum></citerefentry>
    for details) or via the traditional
    <citerefentry project='freebsd'><refentrytitle>inetd</refentrytitle><manvolnum>8</manvolnum></citerefentry>-style
    socket passing (i.e. sockets passed in via standard input and
    output, using <varname>StandardInput=socket</varname> in the
    service file).</para>
  </refsect1>

  <refsect1>
    <title>Options</title>

    <para>Socket files must include a [Socket] section, which carries
    information about the socket or FIFO it supervises. A number of
    options that may be used in this section are shared with other
    unit types. These options are documented in
    <citerefentry><refentrytitle>systemd.exec</refentrytitle><manvolnum>5</manvolnum></citerefentry>
    and
    <citerefentry><refentrytitle>systemd.kill</refentrytitle><manvolnum>5</manvolnum></citerefentry>.
    The options specific to the [Socket] section of socket units are
    the following:</para>

    <variablelist class='unit-directives'>
      <varlistentry>
        <term><varname>ListenStream=</varname></term>
        <term><varname>ListenDatagram=</varname></term>
        <term><varname>ListenSequentialPacket=</varname></term>
        <listitem><para>Specifies an address to listen on for a stream
        (<constant>SOCK_STREAM</constant>), datagram
        (<constant>SOCK_DGRAM</constant>), or sequential packet
        (<constant>SOCK_SEQPACKET</constant>) socket, respectively.
        The address can be written in various formats:</para>

        <para>If the address starts with a slash
        (<literal>/</literal>), it is read as file system socket in
        the <constant>AF_UNIX</constant> socket family.</para>

        <para>If the address starts with an at symbol
        (<literal>@</literal>), it is read as abstract namespace
        socket in the <constant>AF_UNIX</constant> family. The
        <literal>@</literal> is replaced with a
        <constant>NUL</constant> character before binding. For
        details, see
        <citerefentry project='man-pages'><refentrytitle>unix</refentrytitle><manvolnum>7</manvolnum></citerefentry>.</para>

        <para>If the address string is a single number, it is read as
        port number to listen on via IPv6. Depending on the value of
        <varname>BindIPv6Only=</varname> (see below) this might result
        in the service being available via both IPv6 and IPv4
        (default) or just via IPv6.
        </para>

        <para>If the address string is a string in the format
        v.w.x.y:z, it is read as IPv4 specifier for listening on an
        address v.w.x.y on a port z.</para>

        <para>If the address string is a string in the format [x]:y,
        it is read as IPv6 address x on a port y. Note that this might
        make the service available via IPv4, too, depending on the
        <varname>BindIPv6Only=</varname> setting (see below).
        </para>

        <para>Note that <constant>SOCK_SEQPACKET</constant> (i.e.
        <varname>ListenSequentialPacket=</varname>) is only available
        for <constant>AF_UNIX</constant> sockets.
        <constant>SOCK_STREAM</constant> (i.e.
        <varname>ListenStream=</varname>) when used for IP sockets
        refers to TCP sockets, <constant>SOCK_DGRAM</constant> (i.e.
        <varname>ListenDatagram=</varname>) to UDP.</para>

        <para>These options may be specified more than once in which
        case incoming traffic on any of the sockets will trigger
        service activation, and all listed sockets will be passed to
        the service, regardless of whether there is incoming traffic
        on them or not. If the empty string is assigned to any of
        these options, the list of addresses to listen on is reset,
        all prior uses of any of these options will have no
        effect.</para>

        <para>It is also possible to have more than one socket unit
        for the same service when using <varname>Service=</varname>,
        and the service will receive all the sockets configured in all
        the socket units. Sockets configured in one unit are passed in
        the order of configuration, but no ordering between socket
        units is specified.</para>

        <para>If an IP address is used here, it is often desirable to
        listen on it before the interface it is configured on is up
        and running, and even regardless of whether it will be up and
        running at any point. To deal with this, it is recommended to
        set the <varname>FreeBind=</varname> option described
        below.</para></listitem>

        only one service unit is spawned for all connections (also see
        above). This value is ignored for datagram sockets and FIFOs
        where a single service unit unconditionally handles all
        incoming traffic. Defaults to <option>false</option>. For
        performance reasons, it is recommended to write new daemons
        only in a way that is suitable for
        <option>Accept=false</option>. A daemon listening on an
        <constant>AF_UNIX</constant> socket may, but does not need to,
        call
        <citerefentry><refentrytitle>close</refentrytitle><manvolnum>2</manvolnum></citerefentry>
        on the received socket before exiting. However, it must not
