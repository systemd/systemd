    <title>Description</title>

    <para>Network interfaces names and MAC addresses may be generated based on certain stable interface
    attributes. This is possible when there is enough information about the device to generate those
    attributes and the use of this information is configured. This page describes interface naming, i.e. what
    possible names may be generated. Those names are generated by the
    <citerefentry><refentrytitle>systemd-udevd.service</refentrytitle><manvolnum>8</manvolnum></citerefentry>
    builtin <command>net_id</command> and exported as udev properties
    (<varname>ID_NET_NAME_ONBOARD=</varname>, <varname>ID_NET_LABEL_ONBOARD=</varname>,
    <varname>ID_NET_NAME_PATH=</varname>, <varname>ID_NET_NAME_SLOT=</varname>).</para>

    <para>Names and MAC addresses are derived from various stable device metadata attributes. Newer versions
    of udev take more of these attributes into account, improving (and thus possibly changing) the names and
    addresses used for the same devices. Different versions of those generation rules are called "naming
    schemes". The default naming scheme is chosen at compilation time. Usually this will be the latest
    implemented version, but it is also possible to set one of the older versions to preserve
    compatibility. This may be useful for example for distributions, which may introduce new versions of
    systemd in stable releases without changing the naming scheme. The naming scheme may also be overridden
    using the <varname>net.naming-scheme=</varname> kernel command line switch, see
    <citerefentry><refentrytitle>systemd-udevd.service</refentrytitle><manvolnum>8</manvolnum></citerefentry>.
    Available naming schemes are described below.</para>

    <para>After the udev proprties have been generated, appropriate udev rules may be used to actually rename
    devices based on those properties. See the description of <varname>NamePolicy=</varname> and
    <varname>MACAddressPolicy=</varname> in

        <varlistentry>
          <term><constant>v239</constant></term>

          <listitem><para>Naming was changed for virtual network interfaces created with SR-IOV and NPAR and
          for devices where the PCI network controller device does not have a slot number associated.</para>

          <para>SR-IOV virtual devices are named based on the name of the parent interface, with a suffix of
          <literal>v<replaceable>port</replaceable></literal>, where <replaceable>port</replaceable> is the
          virtual device number. Previously those virtual devices were named as if completely independent.
          </para>

          <para>The ninth and later NPAR virtual devices are named following the scheme used for the first
          eight NPAR partitions. Previously those devices were not renamed and the kernel default
          ("eth<replaceable>N</replaceable>") was used.</para>

          <para>Names are also generated for PCI devices where the PCI network controller device does not
          have an associated slot number itself, but one of its parents does. Previously those devices were
          not renamed and the kernel default was used.</para>

          <listitem><para>The <literal>ib</literal> prefix and stable names for infiniband devices are
          introduced. Previously those devices were not renamed.</para>

          <para>The ACPI index field (used in <varname>ID_NET_NAME_ONBOARD=</varname>) is now also used when
          0.</para>

          <para>A new naming policy <varname>NamePolicy=keep</varname> was introduced. With this policy, if
          the network device name was already set by userspace, the device will not be renamed
          again. Previously, this naming policy applied implicitly, and now it must be explicitly
          requested. Effectively, this means that network devices will be renamed according to the
          configuration, even if they have been renamed already, if <constant>keep</constant> is not
          specified as the naming policy in the <filename noindex='true'>.link</filename> file. See

          <varname noindex='true'>ID_NET_NAME_*</varname> attributes, which meant that interface names would
          never be generated for virtual devices. Now a persistent address will be generated for most
          devices, including in particular bridges.</para>

          <para>Note: when userspace does not set a MAC address for a bridge device, the kernel will
          initially assign a random address, and then change it when the first device is enslaved to the
          bridge. With this naming policy change, bridges get a persistent MAC address based on the bridge
          name instead of the first enslaved device.</para></listitem>
