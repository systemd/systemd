                <para><command>systemd-sysusers</command> uses the
                files from <filename>/usr/lib/sysusers.d/</filename>
                to create system users and groups at package
                installation or boot time. This tool may be used for
                allocating system users and groups only, it is not
                useful for creating non-system users and groups, as it
                accessed <filename>/etc/passwd</filename> and
                <filename>/etc/group</filename> directly, bypassing
                any more complex user database, for example any
                database involving NIS or LDAP.</para>

                <title>File Format</title>

                <para>Each file shall be named in the style of
                <filename><replaceable>package</replaceable>.conf</filename>.</para>

                <para>All files are sorted by their filename in
                lexicographic order, regardless of which of the
                directories they reside in. If multiple files specify
                the same user or group, the entry in the file with the
                lexicographically earliest name will be applied, all
                all other conflicting entries will be logged as
                errors. Users and groups are
                processed in the order they are listed.</para>

                <para>The file format is one line per user or group
                containing name, ID and GECOS field description:</para>

                        <title>Name</title>

                        <para>The name field specifies the user or
                        group name. It should be be shorter than 256
                        characters and avoid any non-ASCII characters,
                        and not begin with a numeric character. It is
                        strongly recommended to pick user and group
                        names that are unlikely to clash with normal
                        users created by the administrator. A good
                        scheme to guarantee this is by prefixing all
                        system and group names with the underscore,
                        and avoiding too generic names.</para>

                        <para>For <varname>m</varname> lines this
                        field should contain the user name to add to a

                        <varname>g</varname> the numeric 32bit UID or
                        GID of the user/group. Do not use IDs 65535 or
                        4294967295, as they have special placeholder
                        meanings. Specify "-" for automatic UID/GID
                        allocation for the user or
                        group. Alternatively, specify an absolute path
                        in the file system. In this case the UID/GID
                        is read from the path's owner/group. This is
                        useful to create users whose UID/GID match the
                        owners of pre-existing files (such as SUID or
                        SGID binaries).</para>
