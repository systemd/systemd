    <title>Description</title>

    <para>Unit configuration files for services, slices, scopes, sockets, mount points, and swap devices share a subset
    of configuration options for resource control of spawned processes. Internally, this relies on the Linux Control
    Groups (cgroups) kernel concept for organizing processes in a hierarchical tree of named groups for the purpose of
    resource management.</para>

    <para>This man page lists the configuration options shared by
    those six unit types. See
    <citerefentry><refentrytitle>systemd.unit</refentrytitle><manvolnum>5</manvolnum></citerefentry>
    for the common options of all unit configuration files, and
    <citerefentry><refentrytitle>systemd.slice</refentrytitle><manvolnum>5</manvolnum></citerefentry>,

    and
    <citerefentry><refentrytitle>systemd.swap</refentrytitle><manvolnum>5</manvolnum></citerefentry>
    for more information on the specific unit configuration files. The
    resource control configuration options are configured in the
    [Slice], [Scope], [Service], [Socket], [Mount], or [Swap]
    sections, depending on the unit type.</para>

    <para>In addition, options which control resources available to programs
    <emphasis>executed</emphasis> by systemd are listed in
    <citerefentry><refentrytitle>systemd.exec</refentrytitle><manvolnum>5</manvolnum></citerefentry>.
    Those options complement options listed here.</para>

      <title>Enabling and disabling controllers</title>

      <para>Controllers in the cgroup hierarchy are hierarchical, and resource control is realized by
      distributing resource assignments between siblings in branches of the cgroup hierarchy. There is no
      need to explicitly <emphasis>enable</emphasis> a cgroup controller for a unit.
      <command>systemd</command> will instruct the kernel to enable a controller for a given unit when this
      unit has configuration for a given controller. For example, when <varname>CPUWeight=</varname> is set,
      the <option>cpu</option> controller will be enabled, and when <varname>TasksMax=</varname> are set, the
      <option>pids</option> controller will be enabled. In addition, various controllers may be also be
      enabled explicitly via the
      <varname>MemoryAccounting=</varname>/<varname>TasksAccounting=</varname>/<varname>IOAccounting=</varname>
      settings. Because of how the cgroup hierarchy works, controllers will be automatically enabled for all
      parent units and for any sibling units starting with the lowest level at which a controller is enabled.
      Units for which a controller is enabled may be subject to resource control even if they do not have any
      explicit configuration.</para>

      <para>Setting <varname>Delegate=</varname> enables any delegated controllers for that unit (see below).
      The delegatee may then enable controllers for its children as appropriate. In particular, if the
      delegatee is <command>systemd</command> (in the <filename>user@.service</filename> unit), it will
      repeat the same logic as the system instance and enable controllers for user units which have resource
      limits configured, and their siblings and parents and parents' siblings.</para>

      <para>Controllers may be <emphasis>disabled</emphasis> for parts of the cgroup hierarchy with
      <varname>DisableControllers=</varname> (see below).</para>

        <programlisting>
                      -.slice
                     /       \
              /-----/         \--------------\

      /           \              user@42.service  user@1000.service
     /             \             Delegate=        Delegate=yes
a.service       b.slice                             /        \
CPUWeight=20   DisableControllers=cpu              /          \
                 /  \                      app.slice      session.slice
                /    \                     CPUWeight=100  CPUWeight=100
               /      \
       b1.service   b2.service
                    CPUWeight=1000
</programlisting>

        <para>In this hierarchy, the <option>cpu</option> controller is enabled for all units shown except
        <filename>b1.service</filename> and <filename>b2.service</filename>. Because there is no explicit
        configuration for <filename>system.slice</filename> and <filename>user.slice</filename>, CPU
        resources will be split equally between them. Similarly, resources are allocated equally between
        children of <filename>user.slice</filename> and between the child slices beneath
        <filename>user@1000.service</filename>. Assuming that there is no further configuration of resources
        or delegation below slices <filename>app.slice</filename> or <filename>session.slice</filename>, the
        <option>cpu</option> controller would not be enabled for units in those slices and CPU resources
        would be further allocated using other mechanisms, e.g. based on nice levels. The manager for user
        42 has delegation enabled without any controllers, i.e. it can manipulate its subtree of the cgroup
        hierarchy, but without resource control.</para>

        <para>In the slice <filename>system.slice</filename>, CPU resources are split 1:6 for service
        <filename>a.service</filename>, and 5:6 for slice <filename>b.slice</filename>, because slice
        <filename>b.slice</filename> gets the default value of 100 for <filename>cpu.weight</filename> when
        <varname>CPUWeight=</varname> is not set.</para>

        <para><varname>CPUWeight=</varname> setting in service <filename>b2.service</filename> is neutralized
        by <varname>DisableControllers=</varname> in slice <filename>b.slice</filename>, so the
        <option>cpu</option> controller would not be enabled for services <filename>b1.service</filename> and
        <filename>b2.service</filename>, and CPU resources would be further allocated using other mechanisms,
        e.g. based on nice levels.</para>

      <title>Setting resource controls for a group of related units</title>

      <para>As described in
      <citerefentry><refentrytitle>systemd.unit</refentrytitle><manvolnum>5</manvolnum></citerefentry>, the
      settings listed here may be set through the main file of a unit and drop-in snippets in
      <filename index="false">*.d/</filename> directories. The list of directories searched for drop-ins
      includes names formed by repeatedly truncating the unit name after all dashes. This is particularly
      convenient to set resource limits for a group of units with similar names.</para>

      <para>For example, every user gets their own slice
      <filename>user-<replaceable>nnn</replaceable>.slice</filename>. Drop-ins with local configuration that
      affect user 1000 may be placed in
      <filename index="false">/etc/systemd/system/user-1000.slice</filename>,
      <filename index="false">/etc/systemd/system/user-1000.slice.d/*.conf</filename>, but also
      <filename index="false">/etc/systemd/system/user-.slice.d/*.conf</filename>. This last directory
      applies to all user slices.</para>

          <para>Specify the memory usage protection of the executed processes in this unit.
          When reclaiming memory, the unit is treated as if it was using less memory resulting in memory
          to be preferentially reclaimed from unprotected units.
          Using <varname>MemoryLow=</varname> results in a weaker protection where memory may still
          be reclaimed to avoid invoking the OOM killer in case there is no other reclaimable memory.</para>
          <para>
          For a protection to be effective, it is generally required to set a corresponding
          allocation on all ancestors, which is then distributed between children
          (with the exception of the root slice).
          Any <varname>MemoryMin=</varname> or <varname>MemoryLow=</varname> allocation that is not
          explicitly distributed to specific children is used to create a shared protection for all children.
          As this is a shared protection, the children will freely compete for the memory.</para>

          <para>Takes a memory size in bytes. If the value is suffixed with K, M, G or T, the specified memory size is
          parsed as Kilobytes, Megabytes, Gigabytes, or Terabytes (with the base 1024), respectively. Alternatively, a
          percentage value may be specified, which is taken relative to the installed physical memory on the
          system. If assigned the special value <literal>infinity</literal>, all available memory is protected, which may be
          useful in order to always inherit all of the protection afforded by ancestors.
          This controls the <literal>memory.min</literal> or <literal>memory.low</literal> control group attribute.
          For details about this control group attribute, see <ulink
          url="https://docs.kernel.org/admin-guide/cgroup-v2.html#memory-interface-files">Memory Interface Files</ulink>.</para>

          <para>Units may have their children use a default <literal>memory.min</literal> or
          <literal>memory.low</literal> value by specifying <varname>DefaultMemoryMin=</varname> or
          <varname>DefaultMemoryLow=</varname>, which has the same semantics as
          <varname>MemoryMin=</varname> and <varname>MemoryLow=</varname>, or <varname>DefaultStartupMemoryLow=</varname>
          which has the same semantics as <varname>StartupMemoryLow=</varname>.
          This setting does not affect <literal>memory.min</literal> or <literal>memory.low</literal>
          in the unit itself.
          Using it to set a default child allocation is only useful on kernels older than 5.7,

          <para>Turn on network traffic filtering for IP packets sent and received over
          <constant>AF_INET</constant> and <constant>AF_INET6</constant> sockets. Both directives take a
          space separated list of IPv4 or IPv6 addresses, each optionally suffixed with an address prefix
          length in bits after a <literal>/</literal> character. If the suffix is omitted, the address is
          considered a host address, i.e. the filter covers the whole address (32 bits for IPv4, 128 bits for
          IPv6).</para>

          <para>The access lists configured with this option are applied to all sockets created by processes
          of this unit (or in the case of socket units, associated with it). The lists are implicitly
          combined with any lists configured for any of the parent slice units this unit might be a member
          of. By default, both access lists are empty. Both ingress and egress traffic is filtered by these
          settings. In case of ingress traffic the source IP address is checked against these access lists,
          in case of egress traffic the destination IP address is checked. The following rules are applied in
          turn:</para>

          <itemizedlist>

            <listitem><para>Otherwise, access is granted.</para></listitem>
          </itemizedlist>

          <para>In order to implement an allow-listing IP firewall, it is recommended to use a
          <varname>IPAddressDeny=</varname><constant>any</constant> setting on an upper-level slice unit
          (such as the root slice <filename>-.slice</filename> or the slice containing all system services
          <filename>system.slice</filename> – see
          <citerefentry><refentrytitle>systemd.special</refentrytitle><manvolnum>7</manvolnum></citerefentry>
          for details on these slice units), plus individual per-service <varname>IPAddressAllow=</varname>
          lines permitting network access to relevant services, and only them.</para>

          <para>Note that for socket-activated services, the IP access list configured on the socket unit
          applies to all sockets associated with it directly, but not to any sockets created by the
          ultimately activated services for it. Conversely, the IP access list configured for the service is
          not applied to any sockets passed into the service via socket activation. Thus, it is usually a
          good idea to replicate the IP access lists on both the socket and the service unit. Nevertheless,
          it may make sense to maintain one list more open and the other one more restricted, depending on
          the use case.</para>

          <para>If these settings are used multiple times in the same unit the specified lists are combined. If an
          empty string is assigned to these settings the specific access list is reset and all previous settings undone.</para>

          <para>Takes a list of space-separated network interface names. This option restricts the network

          the processes can only use network interfaces not listed (deny-list).

          <para>This setting provides a method for integrating dynamic cgroup, user and group IDs into
          firewall rules with <ulink url="https://netfilter.org/projects/nftables/index.html">NFT</ulink>
          sets. The benefit of using this setting is to be able to use the IDs as selectors in firewall rules
          easily and this in turn allows more fine grained filtering. NFT rules for cgroup matching use
          numeric cgroup IDs, which change every time a service is restarted, making them hard to use in
          systemd environment otherwise. Dynamic and random IDs used by <varname>DynamicUser=</varname> can
          be also integrated with this setting.</para>

          <para>This option expects a whitespace separated list of NFT set definitions. Each definition
          consists of a colon-separated tuple of source type (one of <literal>cgroup</literal>,
          <literal>user</literal> or <literal>group</literal>), NFT address family (one of
          <literal>arp</literal>, <literal>bridge</literal>, <literal>inet</literal>, <literal>ip</literal>,
          <literal>ip6</literal>, or <literal>netdev</literal>), table name and set name. The names of tables
          and sets must conform to lexical restrictions of NFT table names. The type of the element used in
          the NFT filter must match the type implied by the directive (<literal>cgroup</literal>,
          <literal>user</literal> or <literal>group</literal>) as shown in the table below. When a control
          group or a unit is realized, the corresponding ID will be appended to the NFT sets and it will be
          be removed when the control group or unit is removed. <command>systemd</command> only inserts
          elements to (or removes from) the sets, so the related NFT rules, tables and sets must be prepared
          elsewhere in advance. Failures to manage the sets will be ignored.</para>

          programs loaded to the BPF filesystem are attached with cgroup-bpf attach flags determined by the
          unit. For details about attachment types and flags see <ulink

          <para>Control access to specific device nodes by the executed processes. Takes two space-separated
          strings: a device node specifier followed by a combination of <constant>r</constant>,
          <constant>w</constant>, <constant>m</constant> to control <emphasis>r</emphasis>eading,
          <emphasis>w</emphasis>riting, or creation of the specific device nodes by the unit
          (<emphasis>m</emphasis>knod), respectively. This functionality is implemented using eBPF
          filtering.</para>

          <para>When access to <emphasis>all</emphasis> physical devices should be disallowed,
          <varname>PrivateDevices=</varname> may be used instead. See
          <citerefentry><refentrytitle>systemd.exec</refentrytitle><manvolnum>5</manvolnum></citerefentry>.
          </para>

          <para>The device node specifier is either a path to a device node in the file system, starting with
          <filename>/dev/</filename>, or a string starting with either <literal>char-</literal> or
          <literal>block-</literal> followed by a device group name, as listed in
          <filename>/proc/devices</filename>. The latter is useful to allow-list all current and future
          devices belonging to a specific device group at once. The device group is matched according to
          filename globbing rules, you may hence use the <literal>*</literal> and <literal>?</literal>
          wildcards. (Note that such globbing wildcards are not available for device node path
          specifications!) In order to match device nodes by numeric major/minor, use device node paths in
          the <filename>/dev/char/</filename> and <filename>/dev/block/</filename> directories. However,
          matching devices by major/minor is generally not recommended as assignments are neither stable nor
          portable between systems or different kernel versions.</para>

          <para>Examples: <filename>/dev/sda5</filename> is a path to a device node, referring to an ATA or
          SCSI block device. <literal>char-pts</literal> and <literal>char-alsa</literal> are specifiers for
          all pseudo TTYs and all ALSA sound devices, respectively. <literal>char-cpu/*</literal> is a
          specifier matching all CPU related device groups.</para>

          <para>Note that allow lists defined this way should only reference device groups which are
          resolvable at the time the unit is started. Any device groups not resolvable then are not added to
          the device allow list. In order to work around this limitation, consider extending service units
          with a pair of <command>After=modprobe@xyz.service</command> and
          <command>Wants=modprobe@xyz.service</command> lines that load the necessary kernel module
          implementing the device group if missing.

Wants=modprobe@loop.service
After=modprobe@loop.service

        <listitem>
          <para>Turns on delegation of further resource control partitioning to processes of the unit. Units
          where this is enabled may create and manage their own private subhierarchy of control groups below
          the control group of the unit itself. For unprivileged services (i.e. those using the
          <varname>User=</varname> setting) the unit's control group will be made accessible to the relevant
          user.</para>

          <para>When enabled the service manager will refrain from manipulating control groups or moving
          processes below the unit's control group, so that a clear concept of ownership is established: the
          control group tree at the level of the unit's control group and above (i.e. towards the root
          control group) is owned and managed by the service manager of the host, while the control group
          tree below the unit's control group is owned and managed by the unit itself.</para>

          <para>Takes either a boolean argument or a (possibly empty) list of control group controller names.
          If true, delegation is turned on, and all supported controllers are enabled for the unit, making
          them available to the unit's processes for management. If false, delegation is turned off entirely
          (and no additional controllers are enabled). If set to a list of controllers, delegation is turned
          on, and the specified controllers are enabled for the unit. Assigning the empty string will enable
          delegation, but reset the list of controllers, and all assignments prior to this will have no
          effect. Note that additional controllers other than the ones specified might be made available as
          well, depending on configuration of the containing slice unit or other units contained in it.
          Defaults to false.</para>

          <para>Note that controller delegation to less privileged code is only safe on the unified control
          group hierarchy. Accordingly, access to the specified controllers will not be granted to
          unprivileged services on the legacy hierarchy, even when requested.</para>

          <xi:include href="supported-controllers.xml"  xpointer="controllers-text" />

          <para>Not all of these controllers are available on all kernels however, and some are specific to
          the unified hierarchy while others are specific to the legacy hierarchy. Also note that the kernel
          might support further controllers, which are not covered here yet, as delegation is either not
          supported at all for them or not defined cleanly.</para>

          <para>Note that because of the hierarchical nature of cgroup hierarchy, any controllers that are
          delegated will be enabled for the parent and sibling units of the unit with delegation.</para>

          <para>Place unit processes in the specified subgroup of the unit's control group. Takes a valid
          control group name (not a path!) as parameter, or an empty string to turn this feature
          off. Defaults to off. The control group name must be usable as filename and avoid conflicts with
          the kernel's control group attribute files (i.e. <filename>cgroup.procs</filename> is not an
          acceptable name, since the kernel exposes a native control group attribute file by that name). This
          option has no effect unless control group delegation is turned on via <varname>Delegate=</varname>,
          see above. Note that this setting only applies to "main" processes of a unit, i.e. for services to
          <varname>ExecStart=</varname>, but not for <varname>ExecReload=</varname> and similar. If
          delegation is enabled, the latter are always placed inside a subgroup named
          <filename>.control</filename>. The specified subgroup is automatically created (and potentially
          ownership is passed to the unit's configured user/group) when a process is started in it.</para>

          <para>This option is useful to avoid manually moving the invoked process into a subgroup after it
          has been started. Since no processes should live in inner nodes of the control group tree it is
          almost always necessary to run the main ("supervising") process of a unit that has delegation
          turned on in a subgroup.</para>

          then extended attributes set on descendants of <filename>/user.slice/user-1000.slice/user@1000.service/</filename>
          will be ignored because the descendants are owned by UID 1000, and <filename>-.slice</filename>
          is owned by UID 0. But, if calculating candidates for
          <filename>/user.slice/user-1000.slice/user@1000.service/</filename>, then extended attributes set
          on the descendants would be respected.</para>

          <para>If this property is set to <option>avoid</option>, the service manager will convey this to
          <command>systemd-oomd</command>, which will only select this cgroup if there are no other viable
          candidates.</para>

          <para>If this property is set to <option>omit</option>, the service manager will convey this to
          <command>systemd-oomd</command>, which will ignore this cgroup as a candidate and will not perform
          any actions on it.</para>

          <para>It is recommended to use <option>avoid</option> and <option>omit</option> sparingly, as it
          can adversely affect <command>systemd-oomd</command>'s kill behavior. Also note that these extended
          attributes are not applied recursively to cgroups under this unit's cgroup.</para>

          <para>Defaults to <option>none</option> which means <command>systemd-oomd</command> will rank this
          unit's cgroup as defined in
          <citerefentry><refentrytitle>systemd-oomd.service</refentrytitle><manvolnum>8</manvolnum></citerefentry>

        <term><varname>MemoryPressureWatch=</varname></term>

        <listitem><para>Controls memory pressure monitoring for invoked processes. Takes a boolean or one of
        <literal>auto</literal> and <literal>skip</literal>. If <literal>no</literal>, tells the service not
        to watch for memory pressure events, by setting the <varname>$MEMORY_PRESSURE_WATCH</varname>
        environment variable to the literal string <filename>/dev/null</filename>. If <literal>yes</literal>,
        tells the service to watch for memory pressure events. This enables memory accounting for the
        service, and ensures the <filename>memory.pressure</filename> cgroup attribute file is accessible for
        reading and writing by the service's user. It then sets the <varname>$MEMORY_PRESSURE_WATCH</varname>
        environment variable for processes invoked by the unit to the file system path to this file. The
        threshold information configured with <varname>MemoryPressureThresholdSec=</varname> is encoded in
        the <varname>$MEMORY_PRESSURE_WRITE</varname> environment variable. If the <literal>auto</literal>
        value is set the protocol is enabled if memory accounting is anyway enabled for the unit, and
        disabled otherwise. If set to <literal>skip</literal> the logic is neither enabled, nor disabled and
        the two environment variables are not set.</para>

        <para>Note that services are free to use the two environment variables, but it is unproblematic if
        they ignore them. Memory pressure handling must be implemented individually in each service, and
        usually means different things for different software. For further details on memory pressure
        handling see <ulink url="https://systemd.io/MEMORY_PRESSURE">Memory Pressure Handling in
