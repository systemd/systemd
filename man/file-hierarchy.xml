    <title>Description</title>

    <para>Operating systems using the
    <citerefentry><refentrytitle>systemd</refentrytitle><manvolnum>1</manvolnum></citerefentry> system and
    service manager are organized based on a file system hierarchy inspired by UNIX, more specifically the
    hierarchy described in the <ulink url="http://refspecs.linuxfoundation.org/FHS_3.0/fhs-3.0.html">File
    System Hierarchy</ulink> specification and <citerefentry
    project='man-pages'><refentrytitle>hier</refentrytitle><manvolnum>7</manvolnum></citerefentry>, with
    various extensions, partially documented in the <ulink
    url="https://standards.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/basedir-spec-latest.html">XDG Base Directory
    Specification</ulink> and <ulink url="https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/xdg-user-dirs">XDG User
    Directories</ulink>. This manual page describes a more generalized, though minimal and modernized subset
    of these specifications that defines more strictly the suggestions and restrictions systemd makes on the
    file system hierarchy. Note that this document makes no attempt to define the directory structure
    comprehensively, it only documents a skeleton of a directory tree, that downstreams can extend. Because
    of that traditional directories such as <filename>/usr/include/</filename> or
    <filename>/var/spool/</filename> are not covered, even though it might (or might not) make a lot of sense
    to include them in the structure of an actually deployed OS.</para>

    <para>Many of the paths described here can be queried
    with the
    <citerefentry><refentrytitle>systemd-path</refentrytitle><manvolnum>1</manvolnum></citerefentry>
    tool.</para>

        partition should look for it at this mount point first, and fall back to <filename>/boot/</filename>

      <title>Unprivileged Write Access</title>

      <para>Unprivileged processes generally lack write access to most of the hierarchy.</para>

      <para>The exceptions for normal users are
      <filename>/tmp/</filename>,
      <filename>/var/tmp/</filename>,
      <filename>/dev/shm/</filename>, as well as the home directory
      <varname>$HOME</varname> (usually found below
      <filename>/home/</filename>) and the runtime directory
      <varname>$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR</varname> (found below
      <filename>/run/user/</filename>) of the user, which are all
      writable.</para>

      <para>For unprivileged system processes, only
      <filename>/tmp/</filename>,
      <filename>/var/tmp/</filename> and
      <filename>/dev/shm/</filename> are writable. If an
      unprivileged system process needs a private writable directory in
      <filename>/var/</filename> or <filename>/run/</filename>, it is
      recommended to either create it before dropping privileges in the
      daemon code, to create it via
      <citerefentry><refentrytitle>tmpfiles.d</refentrytitle><manvolnum>5</manvolnum></citerefentry>
      fragments during boot, or via the
      <varname>StateDirectory=</varname> and <varname>RuntimeDirectory=</varname>
      directives of service units (see
      <citerefentry><refentrytitle>systemd.unit</refentrytitle><manvolnum>5</manvolnum></citerefentry>
      for details).</para>

      <para><filename>/tmp/</filename>, <filename>/var/tmp/</filename> and <filename>/dev/shm/</filename>
      should be mounted <option>nosuid</option> and <option>nodev</option>, which means that set-user-id mode
      and character or block special devices are not interpreted on those file systems. In general it is not
      possible to mount them <option>noexec</option>, because various programs use those directories for
      dynamically generated or optimized code, and with that flag those use cases would break. Using this
      flag is OK on special-purpose installations or systems where all software that may be installed is
      known and does not require such functionality. See the discussion of
      <option>nosuid</option>/<option>nodev</option>/<option>noexec</option> in <citerefentry
      project='man-pages'><refentrytitle>mount</refentrytitle><manvolnum>8</manvolnum></citerefentry> and

      <title>Lack of Write Access on Read-Only Systems and during System Recovery</title>

      <para>As noted above, some systems operate with the <filename>/usr</filename> and
      <filename>/etc</filename> hierarchies mounted read-only, possibly only allowing write access during
      package upgrades. Other part of the hierarchy are generally mounted read-write (in particular
      <filename>/var</filename> and <filename>/var/tmp</filename>), but may be read-only when the kernel
      remounts the file system read-only in response to errors, or when the system is booted read-only for
      recovery purposes. To the extent reasonable, applications should be prepared to execute without write
      access, so that for example, failure to save non-essential data to <filename>/var/cache/</filename> or
      failure to create a custom log file under <filename>/var/log</filename> does not prevent the
      application from running.</para>

      <para>The <filename>/run/</filename> directory is available since the earliest boot and is always
      writable. It should be used for any runtime data and sockets, so that write access to e.g.
      <filename>/etc</filename> or <filename>/var</filename> is not needed.</para>

  <refsect1>
    <title>Node Types</title>

    <para>Unix file systems support different types of file nodes,
    including regular files, directories, symlinks, character and
    block device nodes, sockets and FIFOs.</para>

    <para>It is strongly recommended that <filename>/dev/</filename> is
    the only location below which device nodes shall be placed.
    Similarly, <filename>/run/</filename> shall be the only location to
    place sockets and FIFOs. Regular files, directories and symlinks
    may be used in all directories.</para>

    <para>Applications should expect that a security policy might be enforced on a system that enforces these
    rules.</para>
