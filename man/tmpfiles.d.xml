    <title>Description</title>

    <para><command>systemd-tmpfiles</command> uses the configuration
    files from the above directories to describe the creation,
    cleaning and removal of volatile and temporary files and
    directories which usually reside in directories such as
    <filename>/run</filename> or <filename>/tmp</filename>.</para>

    <para>Volatile and temporary files and directories are those
    located in <filename>/run</filename> (and its alias
    <filename>/var/run</filename>), <filename>/tmp</filename>,
    <filename>/var/tmp</filename>, the API file systems such as
    <filename>/sys</filename> or <filename>/proc</filename>, as well
    as some other directories below <filename>/var</filename>.</para>

    <para>System daemons frequently require private runtime
    directories below <filename>/run</filename> to place communication
    sockets and similar in. For these, consider declaring them in
    their unit files using <varname>RuntimeDirectory=</varname> (see
    <citerefentry><refentrytitle>systemd.exec</refentrytitle><manvolnum>5</manvolnum></citerefentry>
    for details), if this is feasible.</para>
  </refsect1>

  <refsect1>
    <title>Configuration Format</title>

    <para>Each configuration file shall be named in the style of
    <filename><replaceable>package</replaceable>.conf</filename> or
    <filename><replaceable>package</replaceable>-<replaceable>part</replaceable>.conf</filename>.
    The second variant should be used when it is desirable to make it
    easy to override just this part of configuration.</para>

    <para>Files in <filename>/etc/tmpfiles.d</filename> override files
    with the same name in <filename>/usr/lib/tmpfiles.d</filename> and
    <filename>/run/tmpfiles.d</filename>. Files in
    <filename>/run/tmpfiles.d</filename> override files with the same
    name in <filename>/usr/lib/tmpfiles.d</filename>. Packages should
    install their configuration files in
    <filename>/usr/lib/tmpfiles.d</filename>. Files in
    <filename>/etc/tmpfiles.d</filename> are reserved for the local
    administrator, who may use this logic to override the
    configuration files installed by vendor packages. All
    configuration files are sorted by their filename in lexicographic
    order, regardless of which of the directories they reside in. If
    multiple files specify the same path, the entry in the file with
    the lexicographically earliest name will be applied.  All other
    conflicting entries will be logged as errors. When two lines are
    prefix and suffix of each other, then the prefix is always
    processed first, the suffix later. Lines that take globs are
    applied after those accepting no globs. If multiple operations
    shall be applied on the same file, (such as ACL, xattr, file
    attribute adjustments), these are always done in the same fixed
    order. Otherwise, the files/directories are processed in the order
    they are listed.</para>

    <para>If the administrator wants to disable a configuration file
    supplied by the vendor, the recommended way is to place a symlink
    to <filename>/dev/null</filename> in
    <filename>/etc/tmpfiles.d/</filename> bearing the same filename.
    </para>

    <para>The configuration format is one line per path containing
    type, path, mode, ownership, age, and argument fields:</para>

    <programlisting>#Type Path        Mode UID  GID  Age Argument
    d    /run/user   0755 root root 10d -
    L    /tmp/foobar -    -    -    -   /dev/null</programlisting>

    <para>Fields may be enclosed within quotes and contain C-style escapes.</para>

    <refsect2>
      <title>Type</title>

      <para>The type consists of a single letter and optionally an
      exclamation mark.</para>

      <para>The following line types are understood:</para>

      <variablelist>
        <varlistentry>
          <term><varname>f</varname></term>
          <listitem><para>Create a file if it does not exist yet. If
          the argument parameter is given, it will be written to the
          file. Does not follow symlinks.</para></listitem>

        <varlistentry>

          <listitem><para>Create or truncate a file. If the argument
          parameter is given, it will be written to the file. Does not follow symlinks.</para>
          </listitem>
        </varlistentry>

        <varlistentry>
          <term><varname>w</varname></term>
          <listitem><para>Write the argument parameter to a file, if
          the file exists.  Lines of this type accept shell-style
          globs in place of normal path names. The argument parameter
          will be written without a trailing newline. C-style
          backslash escapes are interpreted. Follows
          symlinks.</para></listitem>
        </varlistentry>

        <varlistentry>
          <term><varname>d</varname></term>
          <listitem><para>Create a directory if it does not exist yet.
          </para></listitem>
        </varlistentry>

        <varlistentry>
          <term><varname>D</varname></term>
          <listitem><para>Create or empty a directory.</para></listitem>
        </varlistentry>

        <varlistentry>
          <term><varname>v</varname></term>
          <listitem><para>Create a subvolume if the path does not
          exist yet, the file system supports subvolumes (btrfs), and
          the system itself is installed into a subvolume
          (specifically: the root directory <filename>/</filename> is
          itself a subvolume). Otherwise, create a normal directory, in
          the same way as <varname>d</varname>. A subvolume created
          with this line type is not assigned to any higher-level
          quota group. For that, use <varname>q</varname> or
          <varname>Q</varname>, which allow creating simple quota
          group hierarchies, see below.</para></listitem>
        </varlistentry>

        <varlistentry>
          <term><varname>q</varname></term>
          <listitem><para>Similar to <varname>v</varname>. However,
          makes sure that the subvolume will be assigned to the same
          higher-level quota groups as the subvolume it has been
          created in. This ensures that higher-level limits and
          accounting applied to the parent subvolume also include the
          specified subvolume. On non-btrfs file systems, this line
          type is identical to <varname>d</varname>. If the subvolume
          already exists and is already assigned to one or more higher
          level quota groups, no change to the quota hierarchy is
          made. Also see <varname>Q</varname> below. See <citerefentry
          project='die-net'><refentrytitle>btrfs-qgroup</refentrytitle><manvolnum>8</manvolnum></citerefentry>
          for details about the btrfs quota group
          concept.</para></listitem>
        </varlistentry>

        <varlistentry>
          <term><varname>Q</varname></term>
          <listitem><para>Similar to <varname>q</varname>. However,
          instead of copying the higher-level quota group assignments
          from the parent as-is, the lowest quota group of the parent
          subvolume is determined that is not the leaf quota
          group. Then, an "intermediary" quota group is inserted that
          is one level below this level, and shares the same ID part
          as the specified subvolume. If no higher-level quota group
          exists for the parent subvolume, a new quota group at level
          255 sharing the same ID as the specified subvolume is
          inserted instead. This new intermediary quota group is then
          assigned to the parent subvolume's higher-level quota
          groups, and the specified subvolume's leaf quota group is
          assigned to it.</para>

          <para>Effectively, this has a similar effect as
          <varname>q</varname>, however introduces a new higher-level
          quota group for the specified subvolume that may be used to
          enforce limits and accounting to the specified subvolume and
          children subvolume created within it. Thus, by creating
          subvolumes only via <varname>q</varname> and
          <varname>Q</varname>, a concept of "subtree quotas" is
          implemented. Each subvolume for which <varname>Q</varname>
          is set will get a "subtree" quota group created, and all
          child subvolumes created within it will be assigned to
          it. Each subvolume for which <varname>q</varname> is set
          will not get such a "subtree" quota group, but it is ensured
          that they are added to the same "subtree" quota group as their
          immediate parents.</para>

          <para>It is recommended to use
          <varname>Q</varname> for subvolumes that typically contain
          further subvolumes, and where it is desirable to have
          accounting and quota limits on all child subvolumes
          together. Examples for <varname>Q</varname> are typically
          <filename>/home</filename> or
          <filename>/var/lib/machines</filename>. In contrast,
          <varname>q</varname> should be used for subvolumes that
          either usually do not include further subvolumes or where no
          accounting and quota limits are needed that apply to all
          child subvolumes together. Examples for <varname>q</varname>
          are typically <filename>/var</filename> or
          <filename>/var/tmp</filename>. As with <varname>Q</varname>,
          <varname>q</varname> has no effect on the quota group
          hierarchy if the subvolume exists and already has at least
          one higher-level quota group assigned.</para></listitem>

      <title>Mode</title>

      <para>The file access mode to use when creating this file or
      directory. If omitted or when set to <literal>-</literal>, the
      default is used: 0755 for directories, 0644 for all other file
      objects.  For <varname>z</varname>, <varname>Z</varname> lines,
      if omitted or when set to <literal>-</literal>, the file access
      mode will not be modified. This parameter is ignored for
      <varname>x</varname>, <varname>r</varname>,
      <varname>R</varname>, <varname>L</varname>, <varname>t</varname>,
      and <varname>a</varname> lines.</para>

      <para>Optionally, if prefixed with <literal>~</literal>, the
      access mode is masked based on the already set access bits for
      existing file or directories: if the existing file has all
      executable bits unset, all executable bits are removed from the
      new access mode, too. Similarly, if all read bits are removed
      from the old access mode, they will be removed from the new
      access mode too, and if all write bits are removed, they will be
      removed from the new access mode too. In addition, the
      sticky/SUID/SGID bit is removed unless applied to a
      directory. This functionality is particularly useful in
      conjunction with <varname>Z</varname>.</para>
    </refsect2>

    <refsect2>
      <title>UID, GID</title>

      <para>The user and group to use for this file or directory. This
      may either be a numeric user/group ID or a user or group
      name. If omitted or when set to <literal>-</literal>, the
      default 0 (root) is used. For <varname>z</varname> and
      <varname>Z</varname> lines, when omitted or when set to
      <literal>-</literal>, the file ownership will not be
      modified. These parameters are ignored for <varname>x</varname>,
      <varname>r</varname>, <varname>R</varname>,
      <varname>L</varname>, <varname>t</varname>, and
      <varname>a</varname> lines.</para>
    </refsect2>

    <refsect2>
      <title>Age</title>
      <para>The date field, when set, is used to decide what files to
      delete when cleaning. If a file or directory is older than the
      current time minus the age field, it is deleted. The field
      format is a series of integers each followed by one of the
      following suffixes for the respective time units:
      <constant>s</constant>,
      <constant>m</constant> or <constant>min</constant>,
      <constant>h</constant>,
      <constant>d</constant>,
      <constant>w</constant>,
      <constant>ms</constant>, and
      <constant>us</constant>,
      meaning seconds, minutes, hours, days, weeks,
      milliseconds, and microseconds, respectively. Full names of the time units can
      be used too.
      </para>

      <para>If multiple integers and units are specified, the time
      values are summed. If an integer is given without a unit,
      <constant>s</constant> is assumed.
      </para>

      <para>When the age is set to zero, the files are cleaned
      unconditionally.</para>

      <para>The age field only applies to lines starting with
      <varname>d</varname>, <varname>D</varname>,
      <varname>v</varname>, <varname>q</varname>,
      <varname>Q</varname>, <varname>C</varname>, <varname>x</varname>
      and <varname>X</varname>. If omitted or set to
      <literal>-</literal>, no automatic clean-up is done.</para>

      <para>If the age field starts with a tilde character
      <literal>~</literal>, the clean-up is only applied to files and
      directories one level inside the directory specified, but not
      the files and directories immediately inside it.</para>

      <title>Argument</title>

      <para>For <varname>L</varname> lines determines the destination
      path of the symlink. For <varname>c</varname> and
      <varname>b</varname>, determines the major/minor of the device
      node, with major and minor formatted as integers, separated by
      <literal>:</literal>, e.g.  <literal>1:3</literal>. For
      <varname>f</varname>, <varname>F</varname>, and
      <varname>w</varname>, the argument may be used to specify a short string that
      is written to the file, suffixed by a newline. For
      <varname>C</varname>, specifies the source file or
      directory. For <varname>t</varname> and <varname>T</varname>,
      determines extended attributes to be set. For
      <varname>a</varname> and <varname>A</varname>, determines ACL
      attributes to be set. For <varname>h</varname> and
      <varname>H</varname>, determines the file attributes to
      set. Ignored for all other lines.</para>
