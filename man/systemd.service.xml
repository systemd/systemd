                <title>Description</title>

                <para>A unit configuration file whose name ends in
                <filename>.service</filename> encodes information
                about a process controlled and supervised by
                systemd.</para>

                <para>This man page lists the configuration options
                specific to this unit type. See
                <citerefentry><refentrytitle>systemd.unit</refentrytitle><manvolnum>5</manvolnum></citerefentry>
                for the common options of all unit configuration
                files. The common configuration items are configured
                in the generic <literal>[Unit]</literal> and
                <literal>[Install]</literal> sections. The service
                specific configuration options are configured in the
                <literal>[Service]</literal> section.</para>

                <para>Additional options are listed in
                <citerefentry><refentrytitle>systemd.exec</refentrytitle><manvolnum>5</manvolnum></citerefentry>,
                which define the execution environment the commands
                are executed in.</para>

                <para>Unless <varname>DefaultDependencies=</varname>
                is set to <option>false</option>, service units will
                implicitly have dependencies of type
                <varname>Requires=</varname> and
                <varname>After=</varname> on
                <filename>basic.target</filename> as well as
                dependencies of type <varname>Conflicts=</varname> and
                <varname>Before=</varname> on
                <filename>shutdown.target</filename>. These ensure
                that normal service units pull in basic system
                initialization, and are terminated cleanly prior to
                system shutdown. Only services involved with early
                boot or late system shutdown should disable this
                option.</para>

                <para>If a service is requested under a certain name
                but no unit configuration file is found, systemd looks
                for a SysV init script by the same name (with the
                <filename>.service</filename> suffix removed) and
                dynamically creates a service unit from that
                script. This is useful for compatibility with
                SysV.</para>
        </refsect1>

        <refsect1>
                <title>Options</title>

                <para>Service files must include a
                <literal>[Service]</literal> section, which carries
                information about the service and the process it
                supervises. A number of options that may be used in
                this section are shared with other unit types. These
                options are documented in
                <citerefentry><refentrytitle>systemd.exec</refentrytitle><manvolnum>5</manvolnum></citerefentry>. The
                options specific to the <literal>[Service]</literal>
                section of service units are the following:</para>

                                <para>If set to
                                <option>simple</option> (the default
                                value) it is expected that the process
                                configured with
                                <varname>ExecStart=</varname> is the
                                main process of the service. In this
                                mode, communication channels must be
                                installed before the daemon is started
                                up (e.g. sockets set up by systemd,
                                via socket activation), as systemd
                                will immediately proceed starting
                                follow-up units.</para>

                                <para>If set to
                                <option>forking</option> it is
                                expected that the process configured
                                with <varname>ExecStart=</varname>
                                will start up and call
                                <function>fork()</function>. The
                                parent process is expected to finish
                                when start-up is complete and all
                                communication channels set up. The
                                child continues to run as the main
                                daemon process. This is the behaviour
                                of traditional UNIX daemons. If this
                                setting is used, it is recommended to
                                also use the
                                <varname>PIDFile=</varname> option, so
                                that systemd can identify the main
                                process of the daemon. systemd will
                                proceed starting follow-up units as
                                soon as the parent process
                                exits.</para>

                                <option>finish</option> is similar
                                to <option>simple</option>, however
                                it is expected that the process has to
                                exit before systemd starts follow-up
                                units. <varname>ValidNoProcess=</varname>
                                is particularly useful for this type
                                of service.</para>

                                <para>Behaviour of
                                <option>dbus</option> is similar to
                                <option>simple</option>, however it is
                                expected that the daemon acquires a
                                name on the D-Bus bus, as configured
                                by
                                <varname>BusName=</varname>. systemd
                                will proceed starting follow-up units
                                after the D-Bus bus name has been
                                acquired. Service units with this
                                option configured implicitly have
                                dependencies on the
                                <filename>dbus.target</filename>
                                unit.</para>

                                <para>Behaviour of
                                <option>notify</option> is similar to
                                <option>simple</option>, however it is
                                expected that the daemon sends a
                                notification message via
                                <citerefentry><refentrytitle>sd_notify</refentrytitle><manvolnum>3</manvolnum></citerefentry>
                                or an equivalent call when it finished
                                starting up. systemd will proceed
                                starting follow-up units after this
                                notification message has been sent. If
                                this option is used
                                <varname>NotifyAccess=</varname> (see
                                below) must be set to open access to
                                the notification socket provided by
                                systemd. If
                                <varname>NotifyAccess=</varname> is not
                                set, it will be implicitly set to

                                in relation to SysV services lacking
                                LSB headers. This option is only
                                necessary to fix ordering in relation
                                to legacy SysV services, that have no
                                ordering information encoded in the
                                script headers. As such it should only
                                be used as temporary compatibility
                                option, and not be used in new unit
                                files. Almost always it is a better
                                choice to add explicit ordering
                                directives via
                                <varname>After=</varname> or
