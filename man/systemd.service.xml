                <title>Description</title>

                <para>A unit configuration file whose name ends in
                <filename>.service</filename> encodes information
                about a process controlled and supervised by
                systemd.</para>

                <para>This man page lists the configuration options
                specific to this unit type. See
                <citerefentry><refentrytitle>systemd.unit</refentrytitle><manvolnum>5</manvolnum></citerefentry>
                for the common options of all unit configuration
                files. The common configuration items are configured
                in the generic <literal>[Unit]</literal> and
                <literal>[Install]</literal> sections. The service
                specific configuration options are configured in the
                <literal>[Service]</literal> section.</para>

                <para>Additional options are listed in
                <citerefentry><refentrytitle>systemd.exec</refentrytitle><manvolnum>5</manvolnum></citerefentry>,
                which define the execution environment the commands
                are executed in, and in
                <citerefentry><refentrytitle>systemd.kill</refentrytitle><manvolnum>5</manvolnum></citerefentry>
                which define the way the processes of the service are
                terminated.</para>

                <para>Unless <varname>DefaultDependencies=</varname>
                is set to <option>false</option>, service units will
                implicitly have dependencies of type
                <varname>Requires=</varname> and
                <varname>After=</varname> on
                <filename>basic.target</filename> as well as
                dependencies of type <varname>Conflicts=</varname> and
                <varname>Before=</varname> on
                <filename>shutdown.target</filename>. These ensure
                that normal service units pull in basic system
                initialization, and are terminated cleanly prior to
                system shutdown. Only services involved with early
                boot or late system shutdown should disable this
                option.</para>

                <para>If a service is requested under a certain name
                but no unit configuration file is found, systemd looks
                for a SysV init script by the same name (with the
                <filename>.service</filename> suffix removed) and
                dynamically creates a service unit from that
                script. This is useful for compatibility with
                SysV. Note that this compatibility is quite
                comprehensive but not 100%. For details about the
                incompatibilities see the <ulink
                url="http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd/Incompatibilities">Incompatibilities
                with SysV</ulink> document.

                <title>Options</title>

                <para>Service files must include a
                <literal>[Service]</literal> section, which carries
                information about the service and the process it
                supervises. A number of options that may be used in
                this section are shared with other unit types. These
                options are documented in
                <citerefentry><refentrytitle>systemd.exec</refentrytitle><manvolnum>5</manvolnum></citerefentry>
                and

                options specific to the <literal>[Service]</literal>
                section of service units are the following:</para>

                                is not specified) it is expected that
                                the process configured with
                                <varname>ExecStart=</varname> is the
                                main process of the service. In this
                                mode, if the process offers
                                functionality to other processes on
                                the system its communication channels
                                should be installed before the daemon
                                is started up (e.g. sockets set up by
                                systemd, via socket activation), as
                                systemd will immediately proceed
                                starting follow-up units.</para>

                                <para>If set to
                                <option>forking</option> it is
                                expected that the process configured
                                with <varname>ExecStart=</varname>
                                will call <function>fork()</function>
                                as part of its start-up. The parent process is
                                expected to exit when start-up is
                                complete and all communication
                                channels set up. The child continues
                                to run as the main daemon
                                process. This is the behavior of
                                traditional UNIX daemons. If this
                                setting is used, it is recommended to
                                also use the
                                <varname>PIDFile=</varname> option, so
                                that systemd can identify the main
                                process of the daemon. systemd will
                                proceed starting follow-up units as
                                soon as the parent process
                                exits.</para>

                                <para>Behavior of
                                <option>oneshot</option> is similar
                                to <option>simple</option>, however
                                it is expected that the process has to
                                exit before systemd starts follow-up
                                units. <varname>RemainAfterExit=</varname>
                                is particularly useful for this type
                                of service.</para>

                                <para>Behavior of
                                <option>dbus</option> is similar to
                                <option>simple</option>, however it is
                                expected that the daemon acquires a
                                name on the D-Bus bus, as configured
                                by
                                <varname>BusName=</varname>. systemd
                                will proceed starting follow-up units
                                after the D-Bus bus name has been
                                acquired. Service units with this
                                option configured implicitly gain
                                dependencies on the
                                <filename>dbus.socket</filename>
                                unit. This type is the default if
                                <varname>BusName=</varname> is
                                specified.</para>

                                <option>notify</option> is similar to
                                <option>simple</option>, however it is
                                expected that the daemon sends a
                                notification message via
                                <citerefentry><refentrytitle>sd_notify</refentrytitle><manvolnum>3</manvolnum></citerefentry>
                                or an equivalent call when it finished
                                starting up. systemd will proceed
                                starting follow-up units after this
                                notification message has been sent. If
                                this option is used
                                <varname>NotifyAccess=</varname> (see
                                below) should be set to open access to
                                the notification socket provided by
                                systemd. If
                                <varname>NotifyAccess=</varname> is
                                not set, it will be implicitly set to
                                <option>main</option>.</para>

                                <para>Behavior of
                                <option>idle</option> is very similar
                                to <option>simple</option>, however
                                actual execution of the service
                                binary is delayed until all jobs are
                                dispatched. This may be used to avoid
                                interleaving of output of shell
                                services with the status output on the

                                incorrect conclusions if a daemon
                                consists of more than one process. If
