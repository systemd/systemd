  <para id="strict">All functions listed here are thread-agnostic and only a single thread may operate on a
  given object at any given time. Different threads may access the same object at different times. Multiple
  independent objects may be used from different threads in parallel.</para>

  <para id="safe">All functions listed here are thread-safe and may be called in parallel from multiple threads.</para>

  <para id='getenv'>The code described here uses
  <citerefentry project='man-pages'><refentrytitle>getenv</refentrytitle><manvolnum>3</manvolnum></citerefentry>,
  which is declared to be not multi-thread-safe. This means that the code calling the functions described
  here must not call
  <citerefentry project='man-pages'><refentrytitle>setenv</refentrytitle><manvolnum>3</manvolnum></citerefentry>
  from a parallel thread. It is recommended to only do calls to <function>setenv()</function>
  from an early phase of the program when no other threads have been started.</para>
