    <title>Description</title>

    <para><command>homectl</command> may be used to create, remove, change or inspect a user's home
    directory. It's primarily a command interfacing with
    <citerefentry><refentrytitle>systemd-homed.service</refentrytitle><manvolnum>8</manvolnum></citerefentry>
    which manages home directories of users.</para>

    <para>Home directories managed by <filename>systemd-homed.service</filename> are self-contained, and thus
    include the user's full metadata record in the home's data storage itself, making them easy to migrate
    between machines. In particular, a home directory describes a matching user record, and every user record
    managed by <filename>systemd-homed.service</filename> also implies existence and encapsulation of a home
    directory. The user account and home directory become the same concept.</para>

    <para>The following backing storage mechanisms are supported:</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem><para>An individual LUKS2 encrypted loopback file for a user, stored in
      <filename>/home/*.home</filename>. At login the file system contained in this files is mounted, after
      the LUKS2 encrypted volume has been attached. The user's password is identical to the encryption
      passphrase of the LUKS2 volume. Access to data without preceding user authentication is thus not
      possible, even for the system administrator. This storage mechanism provides the strongest data
      security and is thus recommended.</para></listitem>

      <listitem><para>Similar, but the LUKS2 encrypted file system is located on regular block device, such
      as a USB storage stick. In this mode home directories and all data they include are nicely migratable
      between machines, simply by plugging the USB stick into different systems at different
      times.</para></listitem>

      <listitem><para>An encrypted directory using <literal>fscrypt</literal> on file systems that support it
      (at the moment this is primarily <literal>ext4</literal>), located in
      <filename>/home/*.homedir</filename>. This mechanism also provides encryption, but substantially
      weaker than LUKS2, as most file system metadata is unprotected. Moreover
      it currently does not support changing user passwords once the home directory has been
      created.</para></listitem>

      <listitem><para>A <literal>btrfs</literal> subvolume for each user, also located in
      <filename>/home/*.homedir</filename>. This provides no encryption, but good quota
      support.</para></listitem>

      <listitem><para>A regular directory for each user, also located in
      <filename>/home/*.homedir</filename>. This provides no encryption, but is a suitable fallback
      available on all machines, even where LUKS2, <literal>fscrypt</literal> or <literal>btrfs</literal>
      support is not available.</para></listitem>

      <listitem><para>An individual Windows file share (CIFS) for each user.</para></listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <para>Note that <filename>systemd-homed.service</filename> and <command>homectl</command> will not manage
    "classic" UNIX user accounts as created with <citerefentry
    project='man-pages'><refentrytitle>useradd</refentrytitle><manvolnum>8</manvolnum></citerefentry> or
    similar tools. In particular, this functionality is not suitable for managing system users (i.e. users
    with a UID below 1000) but is exclusive to regular ("human") users.</para>

    <para>Note that users/home directories managed via <command>systemd-homed.service</command> do not show
    up in <filename>/etc/passwd</filename> and similar files, they are synthesized via glibc NSS during
    runtime. They are thus resolvable and may be enumerated via the <citerefentry
    project='man-pages'><refentrytitle>getent</refentrytitle><manvolnum>1</manvolnum></citerefentry>
    tool.</para>

    <para>This tool interfaces directly with <filename>systemd-homed.service</filename>, and may execute
    specific commands on the home directories it manages. Since every home directory managed that way also
    defines a JSON user and group record these home directories may also be inspected and enumerated via
    <citerefentry><refentrytitle>userdbctl</refentrytitle><manvolnum>1</manvolnum></citerefentry>.</para>

    <para>Home directories managed by <filename>systemd-homed.service</filename> are usually in one of two
    states, or in a transition state between them: when <literal>active</literal> they are unlocked and
    mounted, and thus accessible to the system and its programs; when <literal>inactive</literal> they are
    not mounted and thus not accessible. Activation happens automatically at login of the user and usually
    can only complete after a password (or other authentication token) has been supplied. Deactivation
    happens after the user fully logged out. A home directory remains active as long as the user is logged in
    at least once, i.e. has at least one login session. When the user logs in a second time simultaneously
    the home directory remains active. It is deactivated only after the last of the user's sessions
    ends.</para>

    <title>Options</title>

    <para>The following general options are understood (further options that control the various properties
    of user records managed by <filename>systemd-homed.service</filename> are documented further
    down):</para>

    <variablelist>

      <varlistentry>
        <term><option>--identity=<replaceable>FILE</replaceable></option></term>

        <listitem><para>Read the user's JSON record from the specified file. If passed as
        <literal>-</literal> read the user record from standard input. The supplied JSON object must follow
        the structure documented in <ulink url="https://systemd.io/USER_RECORD">JSON User Records</ulink>.
        This option may be used in conjunction with the <command>create</command> and
        <command>update</command> commands (see below), where it allows configuring the user record in JSON
        as-is, instead of setting the individual user record properties (see below).</para>

        <xi:include href="version-info.xml" xpointer="v245"/></listitem>
      </varlistentry>

      <varlistentry>
        <term><option>--json=<replaceable>FORMAT</replaceable></option></term>
        <term><option>-j</option></term>

        <listitem><para>Controls whether to output the user record in JSON format, if the
        <command>inspect</command> command (see below) is used. Takes one of <literal>pretty</literal>,
        <literal>short</literal> or <literal>off</literal>. If <literal>pretty</literal> human-friendly
        whitespace and newlines are inserted in the output to make the JSON data more readable. If
        <literal>short</literal> all superfluous whitespace is suppressed. If <literal>off</literal> (the
        default) the user information is not shown in JSON format but in a friendly human readable formatting
        instead. The <option>-j</option> option picks <literal>pretty</literal> when run interactively and
        <literal>short</literal> otherwise.</para>

        <xi:include href="version-info.xml" xpointer="v245"/></listitem>
      </varlistentry>

      <varlistentry>
        <term><option>--export-format=<replaceable>FORMAT</replaceable></option></term>
        <term><option>-E</option></term>
        <term><option>-EE</option></term>

        <listitem><para>When used with the <command>inspect</command> verb in JSON mode (see above) may be
        used to suppress certain aspects of the JSON user record on output. Specifically, if
        <literal>stripped</literal> format is used the binding and runtime fields of the record are
        removed. If <literal>minimal</literal> format is used the cryptographic signature is removed too. If
        <literal>full</literal> format is used the full JSON record is shown (this is the default). This
        option is useful for copying an existing user record to a different system in order to create a
        similar user there with the same settings. Specifically: <command>homectl inspect -EE | ssh
        root@othersystem homectl create -i-</command> may be used as simple command line for replicating a
        user on another host. <option>-E</option> is equivalent to <option>-j --export-format=stripped</option>,
        <option>-EE</option> to <option>-j --export-format=minimal</option>. Note that when replicating user
        accounts user records acquired in <literal>stripped</literal> mode will retain the original
        cryptographic signatures and thus may only be modified when the private key to update them is available
        on the destination machine. When replicating users in <literal>minimal</literal> mode, the signature
        is removed during the replication and thus the record will be implicitly signed with the key of the destination
        machine and may be updated there without any private key replication.</para>

    <title>General User Record Properties</title>

    <para>The following options control various properties of the user records/home directories that
    <filename>systemd-homed.service</filename> manages. These switches may be used in conjunction with the
    <command>create</command> and <command>update</command> commands for configuring various aspects of the
    home directory and the user account:</para>

    <variablelist>

      <varlistentry>
        <term><option>--real-name=<replaceable>NAME</replaceable></option></term>
        <term><option>-c</option> <replaceable>NAME</replaceable></term>

        <listitem><para>The real name for the user. This corresponds with the GECOS field on classic UNIX NSS

        <listitem><para>The realm for the user. The realm associates a user with a specific organization or
        installation, and allows distinguishing users of the same name defined in different contexts. The
        realm can be any string that also qualifies as valid DNS domain name, and it is recommended to use
        the organization's or installation's domain name for this purpose, but this is not enforced nor
        required. On each system only a single user of the same name may exist, and if a user with the same
        name and realm is seen it is assumed to refer to the same user while a user with the same name but
        different realm is considered a different user. Note that this means that two users sharing the same
        name but with distinct realms are not allowed on the same system. Assigning a realm to a user is
        optional.</para>

        the user's home directory is mounted to while the user is logged in. This is not where the user's

        <listitem><para>Takes a preferred numeric UNIX UID to assign this user. If a user is to be created
        with the specified UID and it is already taken by a different user on the local system then creation
        of the home directory is refused. Note though, if after creating the home directory it is used on a
        different system and the configured UID is taken by another user there, then
        <command>systemd-homed</command> may assign the user a different UID on that system. The specified
        UID must be outside of the system user range. It is recommended to use the 60001…60513 UID range for
        this purpose. If not specified, the UID is automatically picked. If the home directory is found to be
        owned by a different UID when logging in, the home directory and everything underneath it will have
        its ownership changed automatically before login completes.</para>

        <para>Note that changing this option for existing home directories generally has no effect on home
        directories that already have been registered locally (have a local <emphasis>binding</emphasis>), as
        the UID used for an account on the local system is determined when the home directory is first
        activated on it, and then remains in effect until the home directory is removed.</para>

        <para>Note that users managed by <command>systemd-homed</command> always have a matching group
        associated with the same name as well as a GID matching the UID of the user. Thus, configuring the
        GID separately is not permitted.</para>

        privileges. Note that <command>systemd-homed</command> does not manage any groups besides a group
        matching the user in name and numeric UID/GID. Thus any groups listed here must be registered
        independently, for example with <citerefentry

        Any non-existent groups are ignored. This option may be used more than once, in which case all

        user record. At login time it is decrypted with the PKCS#11 module and then used to unlock the
        account and associated resources. See below for an example how to set up authentication with a
        security token.</para>

        <para>Instead of a valid PKCS#11 URI, the special strings <literal>list</literal> and
        <literal>auto</literal> may be specified. If <literal>list</literal> is passed, a brief table of
        suitable, currently plugged in PKCS#11 hardware tokens is shown, along with their URIs. If
        <literal>auto</literal> is passed, a suitable PKCS#11 hardware token is automatically selected (this
        operation will fail if there isn't exactly one suitable token discovered). The latter is a useful
        shortcut for the most common case where a single PKCS#11 hardware token is plugged in.</para>

        <para>Note that many hardware security tokens implement both PKCS#11/PIV and FIDO2 with the
        <literal>hmac-secret</literal> extension (for example: the YubiKey 5 series), as supported with the
        <option>--fido2-device=</option> option below. Both mechanisms are similarly powerful, though FIDO2
        is the more modern technology. PKCS#11/PIV tokens have the benefit of being recognizable before
        authentication and hence can be used for implying the user identity to use for logging in, which
        FIDO2 does not allow. PKCS#11/PIV devices generally require initialization (i.e. storing a
        private/public key pair on them, see example below) before they can be used; FIDO2 security tokens
        generally do not required that, and work out of the box.</para>

        1…10000, or the special string <literal>off</literal>. If not specified, defaults to 100. The weight
        is used to scale free space made available to the home areas: a home area with a weight of 200 will
        get twice the free space as one with a weight of 100; a home area with a weight of 50 will get half
        of that. The backing file system will be assigned space for a weight of 20. If set to
