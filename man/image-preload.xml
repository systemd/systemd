  <title/>
    <para id="image">Since loading images is usually the slowest part of starting a service, especially when dm-verity
    is involved, when a service using this option is restarted the image(s) will be preloaded asynchronously
    before the service is stopped, in order to remove this major bottleneck from the time window during
    which the service is not running. Available since systemd v259, and requires Linux v6.15 or newer.</para>
