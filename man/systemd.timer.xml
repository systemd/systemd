                <title>Description</title>

                <para>A unit configuration file whose name ends in
                <literal>.timer</literal> encodes information about
                a timer controlled and supervised by systemd, for
                timer-based activation.</para>

                <para>This man page lists the configuration options
                specific to this unit type. See
                <citerefentry><refentrytitle>systemd.unit</refentrytitle><manvolnum>5</manvolnum></citerefentry>
                for the common options of all unit configuration
                files. The common configuration items are configured
                in the generic [Unit] and [Install] sections. The
                timer specific configuration options are configured in
                the [Timer] section.</para>

                <para>For each timer file, a matching unit file must
                exist, describing the unit to activate when the timer
                elapses. By default, a service by the same name as the
                timer (except for the suffix) is activated. Example: a
                timer file <filename>foo.timer</filename> activates a
                matching service <filename>foo.service</filename>. The
                unit to activate may be controlled by
                <varname>Unit=</varname> (see below).</para>

                <para>Unless <varname>DefaultDependencies=</varname>
                is set to <option>false</option>, timer units will
                implicitly have dependencies of type
                <varname>Conflicts=</varname> and
                <varname>Before=</varname> on
                <filename>shutdown.target</filename>. These ensure
                that timer units are stopped cleanly prior to system
                shutdown. Only timer units involved with early boot or
                late system shutdown should disable this
                option.</para>

                <para>Timer files must include a [Timer] section,
                which carries information about the timer it
                defines. The options specific to the [Timer] section
                of timer units are the following:</para>

                                types. For example, by combining
                                <varname>OnBootSec=</varname> and
                                <varname>OnUnitActiveSec=</varname>, it is
                                possible to define a timer that
                                elapses in regular intervals and
                                activates a specific service each
                                time.</para>

                                <para>The arguments to the directives
                                are time spans configured in
                                seconds. Example: "OnBootSec=50" means
                                50s after boot-up. The argument may
                                also include time units. Example:
                                "OnBootSec=5h 30min" means 5 hours and
                                30 minutes after boot-up. For details
